            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have examined your Treatiſe, (entituled <hi>Truths Conflict with Error,</hi>) and find it to be no other, but <hi>Error and Inſolency ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving againſt Truth and Innocency;</hi> and is found to be no more ablier to ſtand, than <hi>Dagon</hi> was to ſtand before the <hi>Ark of the Lord.</hi> I had writ a very conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Piece in Anſwer to the ſeveral Particulars in your Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, and was at the Preſs with it long ſince, but taking theſe things into conſideration, I did return back again with it, and have it lying by me at this time: the Reaſons that cauſed me to lay that aſide at preſent; was,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe I found very little aſſerted by you more, than what I had before anſwered and diſproved. And,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe the anſwering of petty or inconſiderable Objections in controverted Points, is but of little profit to the Reader. And,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, becauſe your ſelf far remote, and alſo ſaying, that you would not appear in the Preſs, or otherwiſe with me in this Controverſie any more, as I was informed by one that
<pb facs="tcp:119763:3"/>
ſaid they had it from your own mouth. And,</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, becauſe I find that it is moſt profitable to the Reader, (for whoſe ſake I have written this) to lay down things in particular Points or Poſitions, and to confirm it by Scriptures, and Reaſons drawn from the Scriptures, which is my method in the following Treatiſe; nevertheleſs I have anſwered every thing cited by you, that hath any weight in it, or at leaſt that which appears of any weight unto me. And,</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, becauſe I had other Points to ſpeak to, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired thereunto by ſome Friends; and ſuch like occaſions calling me thereunto, the which cauſed me to be more brie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in the ſeveral Particulars than I would have been, and to omit that large Diſcourſe which I had written, and to contract my ſelf into a briefer method, and yet large enough to clear up the Truth, and unvail the falſity of that long deceiving Doctrine of Infants Baptiſm; together with ſeveral other Doctrins, which do attend it; the which being read and weighed with an impartial heart, will appear to be the truth as it is in Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Sir,</hi> what may I ſay to animate you to that thing? for as much as the way of Truth is every where ſpoken againſt, and your ſelf, and your Brethren the greateſt Perſecutors thereof: Let not (I pray you) vain imaginations deceive you any longer, perſwading your ſelves, that you are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom God hath revealed his ſecrets unto; and that you are wiſe, and the knowledge of Gods Myſteries are in your hearts, becauſe of your parts and education; Remember ſuch may be deceived, and that the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of old were the greateſt Enemies that our bleſſed Saviour had upon earth, how that they were the men that took counſel, and gave <hi>Judas</hi> Thirty Pieces of Silver to betray his Maſter; and alſo that it was the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> that gave the <hi>Soldiers</hi> large Money to make a lie, to ſay that Chriſt was not riſen from the dead, but his Diſciples came by night while they ſlept, and ſtole him away; which ſaying is reported amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> to this day: and yet
<pb facs="tcp:119763:3"/>
doubtleſs theſe men had human parts and learning, and alſo zeal, and yet for all this had not the knowledge of the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of God; for indeed it is the fulfilling of the Word of the Lord, which ſaith, that God <hi>hideth his Wiſdome from the wiſe and prudent, and revealeth it to babes and ſucklings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sirs,</hi> Let theſe and ſuch like Scriptures as theſe be, (of which there be many) put you upon ſerious tryal, with pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſupplycations, that (if peradventures) God may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen your eyes, that you may ſee the Truth, that ſo you may bring glory unto his Name, for it is not learning will do it, (although it be good in its place) without the inſpiration of the Almighty; and let not Antiquity or Cuſtoms be your guide, <hi>for the aged do not alwayes underſtand judgment;</hi> but wait (at Wiſdoms gate) on God by prayer, ſighs and groans, lay aſide pride and vain-glory, be not conformable to this world, in its pleaſure, honour, faſhions, and friendſhip, and the like; but be ye transformed by the <hi>renewing</hi> of your <hi>minds,</hi> and <hi>put on</hi> the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> and <hi>make no proviſion for the fleſh,</hi> to <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil</hi> it in the <hi>luſts</hi> thereof; and by ſo doing you ſhall come to know what is that <hi>good</hi> and <hi>acceptable,</hi> and <hi>perfect will of God,</hi> and your eyes ſhall ſee out of <hi>obſcurity,</hi> and your ears ſhall hear a <hi>voyce</hi> behind you, ſaying, <hi>This is the way walk in it,</hi> when you <hi>turn</hi> to the <hi>right hand,</hi> or to the <hi>left,</hi> which ſhall <hi>guide</hi> your <hi>feet into the way of peace,</hi> and having <hi>ſerved</hi> your <hi>God</hi> and your <hi>Generation</hi> in the way of <hi>Truth,</hi> the <hi>gates</hi> (that the King of Glory ſhall enter in at) ſhall be <hi>ſet wide o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen</hi> unto you, and all ſuch as <hi>keep</hi> the <hi>Truth</hi> with <hi>uprightneſs</hi> of <hi>heart,</hi> ſhall <hi>enter in thereat,</hi> to their <hi>everlaſting joy</hi> and <hi>feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, never</hi> to have <hi>end;</hi> Which is the deſire of him,</p>

                  <p>I have in the following Treatiſe, ſhewed in a methodical order, what Baptiſm is, and that it is not Sprinkling or ſcattering a little wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the face of the Subject, no, but a Dipping or Plunging, or a thorow waſhing of the perſon Baptiſed; and alſo that the Subjects to be Baptiſed, are not Infants, (as ſuch) but ſuch as have firſt belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Lord Jeſus, or at leaſt ſuch as do make a viſible profeſſion of faith; ſuch were thoſe that <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt Baptiſed, for they came and <hi>confeſſed their ſins,</hi> and was <hi>Baptiſed of him in</hi> Jordan; and alſo when the <hi>Eunuch</hi> ſaid to <hi>Plilip, See here is water, What
<pb facs="tcp:119763:4"/>
hindreth</hi> me <hi>that I may not be Baptiſed?</hi> and he ſaid, <hi>If thou belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth with all thy heart thou mayeſt;</hi> and the <hi>Samaritans</hi> when they did <hi>believe</hi> the things concerning the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>name</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> they were <hi>Baptiſed both men and women:</hi> So that the Scripture is plain, that teſtifieth what Subject ſhould be Baptiſed. And that conceit (or more properly great deceit) about Original Sin, in ſaying, That Infants dying in their Infancy, without being Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed are damned, and ſo bring in Infants Baptiſm to purge away Original Sin; I have ſhewed is no ſuch thing, but a dream of mens own brains, and that there is not one Text of Scripture, from <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> to the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which ſaith, that any ſhall die the ſecond Death for Original Sin; nay, the ſecond Death was not ſo much as threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in any one Text of Scripture, either upon <hi>Adam</hi> or any of his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for that ſin, but the Death of the Body was threatned, and alſo executed, for ſaith the Lord, <hi>Duſt thou art, and unto Duſt thou ſhalt return:</hi> And as touching Mans Mortality, it is a general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Opinion, That the Soul of Man is Immortal and dyeth not, although the Scripture ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt poured out his Soul to death,</hi> and made his <hi>Soul an offering for ſin;</hi> but it is ſuppoſed, that when men die, their Souls (if they have done evil) go immediately to Hell, and in the Reſurrection come again from thence to be judged, to ſee whether they deſerve it yea or nay; as though Souls ſhould be put into their torments before they are tryed and judged, to ſee whether they have deſerved it yea or nay; for although <hi>ſome mens ſins go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to Judgment,</hi> ſo as that they are convicted before death, yet <hi>ſome mens ſins come after</hi> them, that there is not the ſenſe of their ſins at the time of death, but they come after them unto Judgment: theſe things I have ſhewed my opinion upon alſo, the which amongſt men is ſtrangely looked upon, as a groſs Error; however peruſe it for there is no dangerous conſequence in it, for he that believeth it, or he that believeth it not, may both meet with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> in the Kingdom of God, if they walk uprightly, according to their ſeveral meaſures; although if it be a Truth, as it appears to me to be, it is very neceſſary that every godly man know it, for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reaſons that I could give. But as touching the Reſurrection of the Body, (which I alſo have ſpoken to) that is of ſuch weight, that without believing it, and being ſtedfaſt in the ſame, it makes Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching voyd, and Faith voyd, and whoſoever doth deny it, their words <hi>eat as doth a Canker;</hi> and indeed I do not ſee (as yet) how ſuch men as deny it can be ſaved. I have alſo ſhewed the great and univerſal love
<pb facs="tcp:119763:5"/>
of God to all men, which is the ground of Faith and Salvation to all that do believe and be ſaved; which is a very comfortable Doctrine to all men, and I think that none can have cauſe to be offended at it, but ſuch as have their eyes evil, becauſe Gods eye is good. And as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Perſonal Reign of Chriſt upon Earth, (<hi>viz.</hi> on the Throne of his Father <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>Zion</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) is that which cauſeth the godly to rejoyce, with joy unſpeakable and full of glory; and it is that which Chriſt hath commanded us to pray for, though we underſtand it not as we ſhould do, when we pray, <hi>Thy Kingdome come, thy will be done in Earth, as it is done in Heaven:</hi> but that he is to receive a Kindome and Reign upon Earth, I have proved in its particular or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, although briefly.</p>
                  <p>I have alſo added a ſecond Part, entituled, <hi>The good ancient Laws and Statutes of King Jeſus, Vindicated,</hi> wherein I have proved the continuance of all the Laws and Ordinances of the Lord Jeſus, given forth in his laſt Will and Teſtament, with many Objections anſwered; And alſo have ſhewed who is the travelling Woman; ſpoken of in <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellations 12.</hi> and who is her Man-child; and who is the Remnant of her Seed; and to what Wilderneſs ſhe is to flea into; and for how long; and who are the two Witneſſes; and the time and place of their Propheſie; and many ſuch like things, which I have ſhewed my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion upon in the following Treatiſe; and therefore I deſire thee, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Reader, to peruſe theſe things ſeriouſly, and deſire the Lord to give thee an underſtanding heart, to receive it ſo far forth as thou findeth it agreeable to the Word of the Lord, and ſound Reaſon. It ſhould have been publiſhed long before this time, if extraordinary occaſions had not hindred me; therefore it is my deſire, that they that have long waited for it, may excuſe the matter, becauſe many are ſenſible of my great occaſions taking me off from finiſhing of it ſooner: So deſiring the Lord to make it to be a word in ſeaſon unto thee, and to fill thy heart with joy thorow believing, and alſo with the fruits of righteouſneſs, that having thy fruit in holineſs, the end may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting life; which is the deſire of,</p>

And beſides all this, the proper ſignification of Baptiſm is a Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, and Reſurrection, as I before have ſhewed; yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding I ſhall give a few Reaſons here, to prove, that Baptiſm is dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, or plunging: And the firſt Reaſon is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, or <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Secondly, Chriſt was ſo baptized, namely plunged, as you have affirmed in your former Book, and we are to follow his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, therefore are to be covered (as Chriſt was) in Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. And Thirdly, it ſignifieth a Burial, as ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> (<hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12.) and a man cannot be ſaid to be buried unleſs he be covered with earth, or the like.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> And this brings me to the Anſwer of your Objection, <hi>p.</hi> 7. where you ſay, <hi>That Chriſt was buried in a rock, and had no earth to cover him, and therefore it cannot be proved</hi> (ſay you) <hi>that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons baptized, muſt be covered in the water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I Anſwer and ſay, That Chriſt was covered is clear, for his body was put into a new Sepulcher, and a ſtone rowled againſt the door, or mouth of the Sepulcher; for in that age it was uſual to bury the dead in Sepulchers, which are as our Graves; and that his body was covered, is evident; becauſe when <hi>Mary</hi> came
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119763:8"/>
early in the morning to the Sepulcher, although the ſtone was rowled away from the mouth, yet ſhe was fain to ſtoop down to look into it, to ſee whether ſhe could ſee Jeſus; implying, that the earth co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him out of her ſight: but I need not trouble my ſelf to prove that which is ſo clear; for the Scripture ſaith (although I ſuppoſe you had forgot it) That <hi>as Jonah was three dayes and three nights in the Whales belly, ſo ſhall the Son of man be three dayes and three nights in the heart of the earth, Matth.</hi> 12.40. So then as <hi>Jonah</hi> was covered in the Whales belly, ſo was the Son of man covered in the heart of the earth; from whence you may ſee, that the Sepulcher which you ſpeak of, was not wood, but earth; and ſo Chriſt was buried and covered in the heart of the earth: So then Perſons bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized muſt be covered in water, or otherwiſe no ſignification of buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in Baptiſm. And ſo I paſs to the fourth Reaſon, to prove baptiſm to be dipping, or plunging into the water.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. Becauſe Baptiſm is figuratively repreſented by much wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and not by a little; which implyeth the perſon baptized ought to be dipped or plunged, ſo as to be covered in water, as the waters of <hi>Noah:</hi> And <hi>John abiding in Canaan Baptizing, becauſe there was much water,</hi> ſaith the Text; to which you adde theſe two Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Firſt, That <hi>if the waters of Noah was baptiſm, then the ungodly World was Baptized; for plunged, and covered they were, and periſhed, and ſo the periſhing Creatures were Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I Anſwer and ſay, The text doth not ſay that <hi>Noahs</hi> water was Baptiſm, but a figure of Baptiſm. Secondly, It is not denyed that the ſame water that is ſaid to ſave the eight Souls which were in the Ark, was the ſame that drowned them which was out of the Ark: which ſheweth, that the water in Baptiſm muſt not be ſmall (for that is ſaid to be a figure of Baptiſm) but ſufficient to cover the Perſons baptized: That which we may learn from theſe ſayings is this, (and ſo I paſs) That as the waters ſaved thoſe in the Ark, and drowned them that were out of the Ark; even ſo Baptiſm (being figuratively repreſented in it) ſaveth, and cleaneth (inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally) all thoſe that have Faith, and ſo be in Chriſt, the Ark of ſafety; and alſo deſtroyeth all that attempt it, which beleeve not, or are not in Chriſt by Faith; and ſo the Ordinances of Chriſt to one, are the ſavour of life unto life; and to the other, the ſavour of death unto death: therefore take this word of Caution, Take heel
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119763:9"/>
how, and to whom, you adminiſter Baptiſm; let them firſt appear to you that they are in the Ark; which is to ſay, let the perſons Baptized, firſt make it appear to you, by ſome viſible demonſtration, that they have Faith in Chriſt, otherwiſe you ſee that you take a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect way to ruinate them; therefore I ſay, take heed: And ſo I paſs to the next thing, which is,</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>John</hi> did abide at <hi>Canaan</hi> to baptize, becauſe there was much water there: But ſay you, <hi>The much water is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood deep water, but broad and ſhallow, ſo that an Infant could not be covered in it: and that</hi> John <hi>did abide there, becauſe his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples might ſee him adminiſter that Ordinance better than under the ſhadowing Banks of Jordan:</hi> And this is the Reaſon, ſaith my An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt, That <hi>John</hi> did abide at <hi>Canaan,</hi> not that the waters were convenient; that is to ſay, deep to cover the Perſon baptized, but becauſe there was a convenient proſpect whereby his Diſciples might ſee the manner of this adminiſtring of the Ordinance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I Anſwer and ſay, That this kind of reaſoning ſeems to me to be ſtrange perverting of the Scripture: for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, That <hi>John abode at Canaan to baptize, becauſe there was much water;</hi> or it may be read, <hi>abundance of water, or deep water,</hi> from the word, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: But you ſay, That <hi>the reaſon why he tarried there to baptize, was, becauſe there was a convenient proſpect, that his Diſciples might ſee him baptize:</hi> clear contrary to what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith. And if that were the Reaſon (as you ſay) then he might have taken a Pitcher of Water into the Mountain (if ſprinkling would have ſerved the turn; for a Pitcher of water would have bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized very many with your kind of Baptiſm) and the Mountain had been a better proſpect than the Valley.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Canaan</hi> is the ſame water (<hi>viz.</hi> the River) <hi>Jordan,</hi> and takes its Name <hi>Canaan</hi> from the Name of the Village <hi>Canaan</hi> that ſtood by the River of <hi>Jordan,</hi> as you may ſee if you look into the Map of that Country: And ſo it is now, that one and the ſame Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bears many Names, by reaſon of the adjacent Villages and Towns that ſtand by the ſide of it, and the River called by the ſame Name: This being conſidered, the River or Water of <hi>Canaan</hi> was not ſhallow, but deep; for the ſwelling Waves of <hi>Jordan</hi> were great, and this is the ſame River as before-ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Again, Thirdly, it is clear, that <hi>John</hi> Baptized Men and Women there; which ſhould be read (if it were truly tranſlated) that <hi>John dipped Men and Women there;</hi> and if ſo, you and your Authors
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119763:9"/>
muſt be falſe, which ſay, it was not deep enough to dip an Infant; and ſo I leave this Objection, and the Reaſons to prove Baptiſm to be Dipping, although I might adde many more: The Reaſons in ſhort you ſee are theſe:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe the word Baptiſm, being truly tranſlated, is to dip properly, and ſuch like words as before-mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe Chriſt was dipped or plunged, and we engaged to follow his example.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Baptiſm ſignifies Chriſts Burial, and he was covered in the heart of the earth.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, and Laſtly, the Scripture ſaith, That <hi>John</hi> did tarry and Baptize at <hi>Canaan,</hi> becauſe there was much water: ſignifying to us, that much water is requiſite in Baptiſm, whereby the perſon bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized may be conveniently dipped or plunged, ſo as to be covered in the water. And ſo I come to the Second Thing, which is,</p>

                     <head>The Diſcourſe of the Subject which is to be Baptized, whether Beleeving Men and Women, or Infants?</head>
                     <p>To which I ſay, The Scripture will reſolve the Doubt, if we well examine them, who are the Subjects to be Baptized; and therefore I ſhall at preſent lay down theſe Two <hi>Poſitions,</hi> and give you Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Reaſons to prove them.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe the great Law-giver, Chriſt Jeſus, hath taught us (in his laſt Will and Teſtament) to make Diſciples, and Baptize them that are ſo made, as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18, 19. <hi>Go teach all Nations, and baptize them:</hi> or as the Original rendereth it from theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>: <hi>Go Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plize (or make Diſciples in) all Nations, and baptize THEM: &amp;c.</hi> From whence we may (cleerly) ſee, that it was the Mind and Will of Chriſt, that they only ſhould be Baptized that were firſt taught, and made Diſciples; and that Infants are not here (in the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:119763:10"/>
leaſt) included, is plain, becauſe they are not capable to be taught; but thoſe that were commanded there to be baptized, were capable of being taught, therefore could not be Infants. Secondly, Infants are not capable to bear the name Diſciple, becauſe Chriſt ſaith in <hi>Luke</hi> 14.26, 27. That <hi>whoſoever denieth not himſelf, and takes up his Croſs and followeth him, cannot be his Diſciple:</hi> So then Infants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not capable ſo to do, cannot be Chriſts Diſciples; but ſuch as are to be baptized, muſt firſt be taught and made Diſciples, and then bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, as is to be underſtood in the word baptize THEM; that is, ſuch as before have been taught and made Diſciples: from whence you may ſee, that Diſciples (<hi>viz.</hi> beleeving Men and Women) may, and ought to be baptized, it being the laſt Will and Teſtament of the great Law-giver, who alſo ſaith, That <hi>he that beleeveth, and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Mark 16.15, 16. And ſo I come to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Reaſon: which is,</p>

                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Becauſe Diſciples (<hi>viz.</hi> Beleevers) were the Subjects that Chriſt and the Apoſtles baptized, and we are to follow their ſteps: and now to prove that Chriſt and the Apoſtles did baptize ſuch, read <hi>John</hi> 4.1. <hi>When the Lord knew that the Phariſees had heard that Jeſus MADE, and baptized more Diſciples than</hi> John, <hi>though Jeſus baptized not but his Diſciples:</hi> from whence we may ſee that Jeſus MADE Diſciples before he did baptize them; and alſo we ſee it was the Apoſtles and Diſciples practiſe ſo to do, as <hi>Acts.</hi> 8.12. its ſaid, That <hi>when the Samaritans did beleeve, they were baptized, Men and Women;</hi> but no mention at all of Children: ſo then Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers are the ſubjects who are to be baptized.</p>

                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Thirdly, Beleevers are the ſubjects, becauſe none are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as Members in the New Covenant (ſo as to have right to Goſpel adminiſtrations) but ſuch as know the Lord, <hi>viz.</hi> beleeve in his Name; for ſo ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. <hi>For this is the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that I make, After thoſe dayes (ſaith the Lord) they ſhall not teach every one his neighbor, and every man his brother, ſaying, Know the Lord, for they ſhall know me from the leaſt, even to the greateſt:</hi> From whence we ſee, that the leaſt Member in the Goſpel-Covenant muſt know the Lord; but Children of ſeven or eight dayes old know him not, and therefore have not right to Goſpel-adminiſtrations, only beleevers that know God, for they ſhall all know him from the leaſt to the greateſt, as ſaith the text: And ſo I paſs to the Fourth Reaſon: which is,</p>

                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. Becauſe thoſe that have right to be Baptized, may, and ought to eat the Lords Supper, the which is not meet for Children to do; for it is a Feaſt that Beleevers only have a right to partake of: but all baptized ones, even ſuch as have right to the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, have right to the Supper, and all other Covenant Priviledges; for ſo ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41, 42. <hi>Then they that gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Word, were baptized; and the ſame day was added to the Church about three thouſand Souls, and they continued ſtedfaſt in the Apoſtles Doctrine, and Fellowſhip, and in breaking of Bread, and Prayer:</hi> From whence we ſee that no more were baptized but thoſe that gladly received the Word, and they that were baptized con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Apoſtles Doctrine, in Fellowſhip, and in breaking of Bread (<hi>viz.</hi> the Lords Supper) and Prayer, therefore beleeving Men and Women (and not Children) are the right ſubjects of Baptiſm, and ought to be baptized, they having a Command enjoyning them thereunto: And ſo I paſs to the Fifth Reaſon, to prove that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples (<hi>viz.</hi> beleeving Men and Woman) are the only fit ſubjects of Baptiſm: which is,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. Becauſe Chriſt was baptized when he came to be of years of diſcretion (being about thirty years old, as you may read, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.) and Chriſt was given to be a leader to his People, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.4. Now if Chriſt were not baptized before he came to be of years of diſcretion, and he given to lead us an example, then we ought not alſo to be baptized till we be of years of diſcretion, and ſo follow his ſteps: The former of theſe is true, and the Conſequence cannot (in truth) be denied: And ſo I paſs to the Sixth Reaſon, to prove beleevers the only ſubjects of Baptiſm.</p>

                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 6. Becauſe Repentance, and Confeſſion of ſin, is required of Perſons before Baptiſm be adminiſtred unto them; for ſuch was the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> when he was to prepare a People for the Lord, although the People which he baptized were the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo in the Old Covenant, yet they came to <hi>John</hi> and confeſſed their ſins, and were baptized, and it was called the Baptiſm of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; and when they would have been baptized upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of being <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, and Children of the Covenant, <hi>John</hi> did reprove them; ſaying, <hi>O generation of Vipers, who hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned you to flee from the Wrath to come? Bring forth fruit wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of amendment of life, and do not begin to ſay ye have</hi> Abraham <hi>to your Father, for God is able of theſe ſtones to raiſe up Children unto</hi> Abraham; <hi>and now is the Ax laid to the root of the Trees, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119763:11"/>
every Tree which bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewen down, &amp;c.</hi> Peruſe this diligently, and you may ſee that there was no admiſſion unto Baptiſm without Repentance; and it is the very ſame Doctrine that <hi>Peter</hi> taught, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. <hi>Repent and be baptized every one of you for remiſſion of ſins, and ye ſhall receive the gift of the holy Spirit:</hi> Hence you ſee there was Repentance required of ever one that is Baptized; and this is acknowledged by the Old Catechiſm, and Book of Common Prayers: and hence it came to paſs, that the old God-fathers and God-mothers (as we were wont to call them) did confeſs our ſins for us, it being a wicked deceiving invention of Pope <hi>Ignatius,</hi> whereby thouſands of poor ſouls were deceived, the Pope invented it, and the Prieſt readily received it, and it being a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, the people loved to have it ſo: the Prieſt was to ask the child, Whether it would forſake the Devil, and all his works? and the God-father (or Surety) was to Anſwer in the behalf of the Child, as though the Prieſt were a Juglor, and had jugled the mans voice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Child; ſaying, This is our (or my) deſire: and then ask if it would be Baptized? And the Anſwer was returned again (as it were in the perſon of the Child) that it was its deſire; when it was far from deſiring any ſuch thing; and ſo far were the Sureties (them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) from forſaking the Devil and all his works, and from being Beleevers, that ſome were Drunkards, ſome Swearers, and ſome Whore-mongers; and yet did dare, by the means of the Pope his Clergy, to tell God (who is the ſearcher of all hearts) that they did beleeve, and forſake the Devil and all his works, and yet were led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by him at his Will. Conſider, O ye blind Prieſts, how you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the people, and made them beleeve they did well, and worſhipt God, when they told lyes in the face of the Congregation, and ſo did worſhip the Devil: Did you ever read of ſuch a practiſe in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive time? No ſurely: Gods Soul abhors you. But courteous Reader, hence thou mayeſt ſee, that the Pope and the Prieſt did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs by their practiſe, that the perſon baptized muſt confeſs his ſins himſelf, or ſome other for him; which ſheweth alſo, That the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon baptized was firſt to confeſs his ſin, and promiſe amendment of life, and ſo muſt be of mature years before baptized. And now the greateſt part of people being aſhamed of Pope <hi>Ignatius</hi> vanity, (I know not what they will do if they underſtood what they learned in their old Catechiſm) but in very deed and truth, I am ready to beleeve (and that not without ground, the more is the pity) that men are ſo implicit in their Faith, as to beleeve and practiſe ſuch
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119763:11"/>
things in the worſhip and ſervice of God (becauſe it is in cuſtom amongſt men) as they are not able to give an account of either to God or man, nor ſatisfie their own Conſcience (if they would but ſuffer themſelves to be brought to a tryal) but go on like a blind Horſe in a Mill, that hath his circuit limitted and caſt up for him to go in: And is not this a miſerable deluſion of the Devil whereby he hath blinded the eyes (of the underſtandings) of them which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve not, to think if they take their practiſes from ſuch and ſuch wiſe learned men, that they ſhall do well enough, not minding what the Lord hath ſaid (which ſhall ſtand ſure to a thouſand generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) <hi>That he will deſtroy the wiſdom of the wiſe, and bring to nought the underſtanding of the prudent:</hi> and yet theſe fooliſh men will be ſo wiſe for their bodies, that if they take but a ſmall piece of ſilver of either of theſe wiſe men, they will turn it over and over again to ſee whether it be ſilver or counterfeit coyn; but as for their Souls they run a hazard, leaving the tryal of it until the laſt day: and then when Chriſt ſaith, Who hath required theſe things at your hands, being not able to give an account, they ſtand ſpeechleſs, and ſo receive the ſentence, <hi>Take ye that unprofitable Servant, and bind him hand and foot, and caſt him into utter darkneſs, and there his Portion will be weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> And thus I come to the Seventh Reaſon, to prove Beleeving Men and Women to be the only fit ſubjects of Baptiſm: which is,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 7. Becauſe Faith is required of all ſuch as appear before God in any Goſpel-Ordinance, or adminiſtration; becauſe the Goſpel-adminiſtrations are the adminiſtrations of the Spirit, and ſo require a ſpiritual faithful ſeed to participate thereof, contrary to the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations of the Law, which were carnal Ordinances; for <hi>the Law was not of Faith, but the man which did it, ſhould live in it:</hi> but the Goſpel is Faith, and that which requires Faith in all that come to God through it; for as ſaith the <hi>Eunuch, See here is water, what hindreth me to be baptized?</hi> (And <hi>Philips</hi> Anſwer was) <hi>If thou beleeveſt thou mayeſt,</hi> Acts 8.37. implying, that Faith was that which would give him admittance unto it; or the want of Faith would hinder him; for <hi>he that cometh to God, muſt beleeve that he is a rewarder of all them which diligently ſeek him:</hi> And indeed we may ſee, that through Faith it is, that we ſtand in the Grace of God and new Covenant, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. And ſo much briefly to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Reaſon, to prove beleeving Men and Women to be the only ſubjects fit for Baptiſm: And ſo I come to the 8. Reaſon: which is,</p>

                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 8. Becauſe Baptiſm repreſents the new Birth, and is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration to the world, that the Perſon baptized is new born of Water and of the Spirit; and is ſignificantly called, <hi>the waſhing in regeneration, and renewing the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Titus 3.5. Which ſheweth, that they only are to be baptized, which are new born, and thereby to repreſent to the world the work of God upon their Soul, that as they have their Hearts ſprinckled from an evil Conſcience; ſo they repreſent it by having their Bodies waſhed with pure water: not that the water it ſelf (as barely conſidered water) is pure; no, but <hi>the Commands of God, and his Ordinances, are pure, inlightning the eyes;</hi> and ſo <hi>to the pure, all things are pure:</hi> and ſo the Water in Baptiſm may be called pure, it being a pure Ordinance and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting a pure work of God wrought in the Soul: And hence it came to paſs that our blind Prieſts gave thanks to God when they had ſtrewed, or ſprinckled a little water on a Childs face, that the Child was regenerated and born again, as though Baptiſm conferred grace, which if ſo, doubtleſs <hi>Simon Magus</hi> alſo had not been in the gall of bitterneſs after Baptiſm, unleſs he (could, and) had fell from Grace: O you blind guides, what can you declare, a Perſon to be the Child of Wrath, and a Child of God (and an heir to heaven) in half an hours time, without ſeeing any viſible demonſtration of the Work of Grace wrought upon the Soul; and yet notwithſtanding although you do give thanks to God that they are regenerated and born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, yet ſo ſoon as they be capable to be Preached to, you tell them if they will not Repent and Beleeve, and ſuch like things, they ſhall be Damned; and yet deny any falling from Grace. What kind of ſtrange confuſed Doctrine is this! What, half an hour a-go a Child of Wrath, but now (being ſprinkled) it's Regenerated and born again, and an heir to heaven; and ſhortly in a damnable eſtate again, ſo that if it do not Repent, and the like, it muſt be damned! Oh ſtrange Confuſion! It makes me admire how the underſtanding of the wiſe comes to be ſo confounded, only God hath confounded the language of the builders of <hi>Babel;</hi> and hence it comes to paſs that their language is ſo confounded: Take heed therefore of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a way to Heaven of your own inventions. But to paſs this Diſcourſe, you may ſee that Baptiſm repreſents a new Birth, and therefore the perſons baptized muſt firſt be new born, <hi>for that which is born of the fleſh is fleſh, and that which is born of the ſpirit is ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual:</hi> therefore beleevers which are born again, are the only fit ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Baptiſm: And ſo I paſs to the 9. Reaſon, to prove beleevers the only ſubjects ſit for Baptiſm: which is,</p>

Becauſe Baptiſm is a viſible manifeſtation of a Covenant made between God and the Soul, whereby the Soul, viſibly, puts off the old Man (<hi>viz.</hi> the luſt of the Fleſh) and puts on the new Man Chriſt Jeſus in righteouſneſs and true holineſs, not to ſerve any longer according to the Will of the Fleſh, but to God in newneſs of Spirit; and this is that the Apoſtle ſaith to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> Gal. 3.27. <hi>That as many as were baptized unto Chriſt, had put on Chriſt:</hi> which ſheweth, That Baptiſm is a viſible putting on the Lord Chriſt, which requireth Faith in the perſon baptized; for if a perſon ſhould be baptized ten thouſand times, and have not faith, he puts not on Chriſt, and ſo not a fit Subject for Baptiſm; for Baptiſm repreſents a Death and Burial of the old Man, and a riſing to Life in the new Man; which cannot be repreſented by an Infants being ſprinckled, but by a Beleevers being baptized: So then, for as much as Baptiſm is a viſible demonſtration of a Covenant made between God and the Soul, wherein the Soul promiſes to put on Chriſt, and walk in him; and God promiſing to give him his holy Spirit to aſſiſt him in his ſo walking: which ſhews, That the perſon thus Covenanting in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, muſt be a Beleever. And ſo I paſs to the 10. and laſt Reaſon, that (at preſent) I ſhall repreſent unto you, to prove that Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are the only fit Subjects of Baptiſm: which is,</p>

Becauſe without Faith it is unprofitable for any to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before God (in any Goſpel Ordinance) for <hi>without Faith they cannot pleaſe him,</hi> in their ſo appearing before him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>For he that cometh</hi> (ſo) <hi>to God muſt beleeve that he is a rewarder of all them that diligently ſeek him:</hi> Hence the three thouſand belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and gladly received the Word, were baptized: The <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> beleeving, alſo were baptized: <hi>Simon</hi> beleeving was baptized, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. and the <hi>Eunuch</hi> alſo, with the <hi>Jaylors</hi> houſhould: And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith, (or profeſſion of Faith at the leaſt) none were admitted to Baptiſm, although that they were in the firſt Covenant, being <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> ſeed, to whom was the Promiſe; yet they came not to <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm without confeſſion of ſins; and being inſtructed in the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> which was to come, as you may read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. at larg; and thus of old was the practiſe of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, to prepare a Temple for the Lord of <hi>ſanctified ſtones built up a ſpiritual houſe, a peculiar people, to offer ſpiritual ſacrifice to God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. Which clearly proveth, That if the building of God in Goſpel-times be a building through the Spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.19.12. then ſpiritual Beleeving Men and Women are the perſons which
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119763:13"/>
ought to be the ſubjects baptized; and being ſuch fit matter, and ſo fitly joyned together, groweth to be a holy Temple for the Lord: for as the ſtones that <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple was built of, were hewn in <hi>Hieroms</hi> Country before they were brought to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and compacted as a Temple for God (figuratively) to dwell in, even ſo now muſt the ſtones of the ſpiritual building be hewed and fitted before they be laid in that building: Hence our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our commanded his Diſciples to <hi>go preach the Goſpel,</hi> ſo as to make Diſciples by inſtructing of them, <hi>and then to baptize them, and ſuch as did gladly receive the word were baptized, and ſo the Lord added to his Church daily ſuch as ſhould be ſaved:</hi> And this was the way of God of old, and is (the way) and will for ever be found to be the right way of Jeſus Chriſt, who is <hi>the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever;</hi> therefore be not carried away with the inventions of men, but walk as you have had Chriſt and the Apoſtles for an example, doing all things according to the Primitive (patern in the worſhip of God) and <hi>as many as walk according to that rule, peace ſhall be unto them, and mercy upon all the Iſrael of God:</hi> And ſo I leave this Subject, and come to handle the <hi>ſecond Poſition;</hi> which is,</p>

                           <hi>Poſition</hi> 2. That Infants (as ſuch) are not fit Subjects of Baptiſm.</head>
                        <p>IN the Diſcourſe of which, I ſhall Anſwer my Antagoniſt in his aleaged Texts of Scripture, with ſeveral more Objections of that nature (which is not aleaged in his Book) and now briefly to the Reaſons, which ſheweth, That Infants are not fit Subjects for to be Baptized: And ſo to the firſt Reaſon; which is,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe God hath no where in Scripture appointed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to be Baptized, either by Precept or by the Example of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, whole ſteps we are to follow; and therefore it's an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful practiſe; for <hi>whoſoever adds to the Word of the Lord, God will add the Plagues which are written:</hi> And <hi>the Prophet that ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to ſpeak a word in the Name of the Lord, which he hath not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, the ſame Prophet muſt die,</hi> (<hi>Deut.</hi> 18.20. <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.18.) Therefore <hi>add thou not unto his word, leſt he reprove thee, and thou be found a lyar,</hi> Prov. 30.6. But as for Gods wayes (as in the time of the Law) it was very plain, and perfect; as witneſs that Ordinance of Circumciſion, there was the manner of Circumciſion, and the Perſon which was to be Circumciſed plainly diſcovered, as the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:119763:13"/>
of the fleſh, and the Children of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and the time when, even at eight dayes old: nay, his Servants and Slaves were to be Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed; and in a word, no uncircumciſed perſon muſt abide in that Land, nor be accounted of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family: which ſheweth, That (in a ſpiritual ſenſe) none can be accounted <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, but ſuch as are Circumciſed in heart, <hi>(viz.)</hi> thoſe that have the vayl of Ignorance and Unbelief taken away from off their hearts; which cauſeth the Apoſtle to ſay, That <hi>Abraham beleeved God, and it was accounted unto him for Righteouſneſs: Know ye therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that they which are of Faith, the ſame are the Children of Abraham:</hi> So then Infants, not having the vail of Ignorance and Unbelief taken from off their hearts, cannot be accounted of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family; for he <hi>received Circumciſion as a Seal of the righteouſneſs of that Faith which he received before Circumciſion, that he might be the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all them which do beleeve,</hi> Gal. 3.7. Rom. 4.11. So then Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was a Seal of the Father-hood of the Faithful unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> therefore the Faithful only are <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, which cannot be Infants, becauſe they have not Faith; and that they have not Faith, is clear, becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, That there is but one Faith, and that one Faith is wrought in the Soul by Hearing the Word Preached; the which Infants are not capable of, as will be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by all men (as I think:) One word or two more about <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> Circumciſion, (and ſo paſs to the next Reaſon) which is, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> received it as a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of Faith; but none of his ſeed did receive it as a ſeal, neither could do, becauſe they could not have the Father-hood of the Faithful ſealed up unto them, it was only <hi>Abrahams</hi> prerogative; neither was it ever called a ſeal to any of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed; and much more I might ſay: But I paſs briefly to the ſecond Reaſon, to prove Children not fit ſubjects to be Baptized; which is,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Becauſe all that are Baptized, may, and ought to receive the Lords Supper (unleſs they be ſcandalous in their Converſation after Baptiſm, and that hinder them) but Children may not receive the Lords Supper: <hi>Ergo,</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Thirdly, Becauſe Children are not in Goſpel-Covenant, becauſe all that are in Goſpel-Covenant need not to be taught to know the Lord, for they all know him from the greateſt to the leaſt; but children of ſeven or eight dayes old, knows not the Lord, and therefore are to be taught to know him before they be admitted into that Covenant: Again, All that are Members of that Covenant
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119763:14"/>
have right to the Ordinances of that Covenant (as my Antagoniſt ſaith) but the Lords Supper is an Ordinance of the new Covenant, and yet Infants prohibited from that Ordinance, (as you ſay;) O wiſe Prieſt, where is your underſtanding got now? ſurely it is brought to nought, as God hath ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. Again, The Fourth Reaſon why Children may not be Baptized, and ſo brought into Chriſts Houſe, or Vineyard; is, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Infants are not capable to labour there, and Chriſt hath none but Laborers there, as you may read, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.1, 2, 3, 4. And the Fifth Reaſon is,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. Becauſe Infants are not capable to be taught; but ſuch as are Baptized muſt be firſt taught; as <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18, 19. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. Neither did <hi>John,</hi> or Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, baptize any other but ſuch as had been (before) taught; which if they did, I humbly crave my Antagoniſt, or any of his Brethren, to prove it: And if he, or they, do prove it, I do profeſs in the preſence of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God (and men) to renounce my Judgment (in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar) and be of the ſame Judgment with them, and walk in the ſame ſteps: And ſo to the Sixth and laſt Reaſon to prove, that Infants are not fit ſubjects to be baptized; is,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 6. Becauſe they are not capable to confeſs their ſins, nor to know God, nor to beleeve in his Name, nor to witneſs a new Birth, by ſhewing the fruits of Regeneration, the which qualifications muſt appear more or leſs in all that are fit ſubjects of Baptiſm, as I before have proved: And in a word, you (my Antagoniſt) nor any of your Brethren, were never yet able to prove ſuch a practiſe warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table by the Word of God:</p>
                        <p>And ſo I paſs to the Grounds and Reaſons given by my Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt, and others, to prove, That Infants are fit ſubjects to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized: which is, (ſay they)</p>
                        <p>Object. 1. <hi>If the Kingdom of Heaven do belong to Infants, then the Ordinances of the Kingdom doth belong unto them; but the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom doth belong unto them; Therefore the Ordinances of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom doth belong to them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I Anſwer and ſay, That if the Ordinances of the Kingdom do belong to them (as my Antagoniſt ſaith) then is he and the reſt of his Brethren in a great evil, in denying them the Lords Supper; which is (as they ſay) an Ordinance of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and ſo they condemn themſelves in the things which they know.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="15" facs="tcp:119763:14"/>And as for the Kingdom of God, it is taken for ſeveral things in Scripture; it is compared to the preaching of the Goſpel, as a draw-Net, as to Leven, to a Merchant, and to the Church (ſometimes) though very ſeldom, and to Righteouſneſs, and Joy in the holy Ghoſt; and it is compared to the ſtate of Glory, or the ſtate of Glory is called by the name of the kingdom of Heaven, or the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God; and that Infants (as ſuch) have right to everlaſting life and glory by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, I never did deny; but yet notwithſtanding that, they can be accounted of as Members of the Kingdom, in the other ſenſe, that I deny; as firſt, They are not Members of the new Covenant, and ſo conſequently of the Church; becauſe, as I have already ſhewed, that none are Members therof, but ſuch as know the Lord, from the leaſt even unto the greateſt, and ſo need no teaching to know the Lord; but Infants know not the Lord, and therefore are not of the new Covenant or Church of Chriſt: But if you ſhould ask me then how are they ſaved, and by what Covenant? I ſhould tell you, by that gracious Promiſe made by God, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. in theſe words, <hi>the ſeed of the Woman ſhall break the Serpents head:</hi> and indeed had not man ſinned ſince the Fall, he then ſhould have had no need of Baptiſm, or any other act of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as a means of his everlaſting peace; for Salvation is a free gift of God: but when we come to years of maturity, and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, and then like <hi>Adam</hi> tranſgreſs it, we then have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited our happineſs; and hence it comes to paſs that we have need of Repentance and Baptiſm to break off our ſins, that the forfeit which ſin hath laid upon our heavenly inheritance might be remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and then Salvation be given over full into our lap (as I may ſay) as at the firſt; namely, as a free Gift and Repentance; and Baptiſm is of no uſe to ſuch as have not ſinned againſt God manifeſt in Chriſt, the which Infants have not done, and therefore no need of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, as I (in a former Treatiſe) have already ſhewed more at large.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Object.</hi> 2. Secondly, <hi>The Children of Abraham were to be Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed at eight dayes old,</hi> (ſaith my Antagoniſt) <hi>and therefore why may not the Children of Beleevers be baptized about that age?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I Anſwer and ſay, That God did command that the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould be Circumciſed at eight dayes old, but hath not commanded the Children of Beleevers to be Baptized at that age; which if he hath, ſhew the place of Scripture where it is ſo written, and the Controverſie will ceaſe.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="16" facs="tcp:119763:15"/>Secondly, Remember that there was far greater reaſon that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants ſhould be Circumciſed, than Infants now Baptized; becauſe as the firſt Covenant was a Covenant appertaining to the fleſh, with carnal Ordinances; ſo the ſeed that was to enjoy it, was a fleſhly ſeed, and were to receive Circumciſion upon a fleſhly account; namely, that they might be inrighted to dwell in the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> in their Fathers houſe, the which without Circumciſion they might not do: but there is no ſuch damage lyable to the ſeed of Beleevers being unbaptized, ſo as to be cut off from the Nation, or their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe; ſo that as there is not the like command for Beleevers to baptize their Children, as there was for Circumciſion, neither is there the ſame Reaſon for it: But that you may ſee this more at large, read my Book, intituled, <hi>Dagons Downfal,</hi> where it is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed more at large: only this, know, That ſuch as have Faith, the ſame are accounted the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the only fit ſubjects to be baptized; for <hi>not to Abraham and his ſeed, through the Law, was the Promiſe made,</hi> of the heavenly inheritance, <hi>but to his ſeed that was by Faith:</hi> For as ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.8. <hi>The Children of the fleſh, are not the Children of God; but in Iſaac,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt) <hi>ſhall thy ſeed be called; for ye are all the ſons of God by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving in Chriſt Jeſus: for as many as have been baptized unto Chriſt, have put on Chriſt; and if ye are Chriſts, then are ye Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams ſeed, and heirs, according to Promiſe:</hi> therefore plead not your right to Goſpel or Heavenly Enjoyments by vertue of being the Child of a Beleever; for if you were the very ſon of <hi>Abrahams</hi> body, yet it would not avail any thing upon a Goſpel account, as ſaith <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt to ſuch as would have pleaded their intereſt in the Goſpel Covenant and Priviledges, by their being the Children of faithful <hi>Abraham;</hi> ſaying, <hi>Do not begin to ſay, you have Abraham to your Father;</hi> for without you be of the ſame Faith (as if he ſhould ſay) it will avail you nothing: but know, that God is now laying the Ax to the root of the Trees, to cut down thoſe that are unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and raiſe up ſtones, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Gentiles, to beleeve in Chriſt, and ſo to be accounted the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> through Faith; and know that Repentance, or Faith was never required as an antecedent to Circumciſion, as it is required in point of Baptiſm.</p>
                        <p>Again, If it be objected from the words of <hi>Paul, That Children are holy, and therefore may be baptized?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I Anſwer, That their holineſs giveth them not right to Baptiſm, unleſs you can ſhew a text of Scripture which commands, that all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:119763:15"/>
Perſons ſhould be Baptized; for it is the Command makes it a Duty, as the want of a Command makes it Will-worſhip; for we know that <hi>Abraham</hi> was long in Covenant with God, and Faithful, and yet was not Circumciſed till there was a Command given him to do it: And alſo we find, That <hi>Lot</hi> was a very righteous, holy man, and yet never was Circumciſed at all; ſo that it is the Command which makes the Practiſe lawful: and if you have a Command for Infants to be Baptized, or that all holy Perſons muſt be Baptized, produce the Command, and then I ſhall ſay it is lawful: but in the mean time, till you can produce a Commandement (or Example for it, by thoſe, whoſe ſteps we are to follow) give me leave to call it a Tradition of Man, and Will-worſhip. Moreover, Take notice that the Holineſs ſpoken by <hi>Paul</hi> in that place, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.13, 14. is Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Holineſs, ſo that the unbeleeving Wife is as Holy (in the ſenſe there ſpoken, although ſhe be an Infidel) as the Children: for the Text ſaith, The unbeleeving Wife is ſanctified; which is no otherwiſe to be underſtood, but according to that Holineſs, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holineſs, ſpoken of in <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.3. And that you may ſee this alſo more clearly proved, read my former Treatiſe, entituled, <hi>Zions Redemption Vindicated.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And again, If it be Objected out of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1, 2, 3. that Infants were Baptized; becauſe the Text ſaith, <hi>That our Fathers were all baptized to Moſes in the Cloud, and Sea.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>My Anſwer is, That I have alſo formerly proved, That that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm there ſpoken of, was not water Baptiſm; and have given the Reaſons wherefore it was not, and therefore I ſhall omit to ſpeak of that here, and ſhall ſay no more but this, That it is clear, that they were not Children which were baptized, but the Fathers; for ſo ſaith the Text.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, They that were baptized, ſinned, and fell in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; which ſheweth that they were the Fathers, for the Children died not there.</p>
                        <p>And Thirdly, They were thoſe that ſaw the great ſigns, and belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; which was not the Infants.</p>
                        <p>And Fourthly, The Text doth not ſay, that the Infants were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; and if the Concluſion be drawn, That all that paſſed thorow the Sea were Baptized, and ſo conſequently the Infants: I Anſwer and ſay, The word <hi>All,</hi> means none but the Elders, or Fathers of Families reſtrictively; for the Text calls them ſo: or otherwiſe we may conclude, that their Cattel were Baptized, for they alſo paſſed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:119763:16"/>
thorow the Sea; but the Text ſaith it was the Fathers: the which bringeth me to the next Objection; which is, ſay they,</p>
                        <p>Object. 3. <hi>In the time of the Law, when the Father of the Family was in Covenant, ſo was the Children alſo; and ſo we may ſee it to be in the time of the Goſpel, by thoſe Houſhoulds which were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I Anſwer and ſay, That thoſe that ſo think, are much miſtaken; for Chriſt ſheweth that its clear another matter, for his Coming was to deſtroy the old Cuſtoms of the Law that conſiſted in implicite carnal ſhews of Religion; and tells us, that he <hi>came not to bring ſuch Peace, but rather a Sword: a Family and a Houſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt it ſelf, the Father againſt the Son, and the Son againſt the Father; and the Mother and Daughter one againſt another, and a mans Foes to be thoſe of his own houſe:</hi> So that from hence you may ſee; that the Fathers obedience in Goſpel-time, doth not bring the Children to the like Conformity; but ſometimes <hi>the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall riſe up againſt their Parents, and cauſe them to be put to death.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But peradventure ſome will ſay, What do you think of thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Houſholds that were Baptized in the Primitive time, as the Jaylors Houſhold, and <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s, and <hi>Lydia</hi>'s, and the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold of <hi>Stephanus;</hi> and the like?</p>
                        <p>To which I ſay, That they were not Infants which bore the Name of the Houſhold there, but Beleevers: and that you may ſee this, read, <hi>Acts</hi> 33. &amp; 44, 45, 46. that thoſe of <hi>Cornelius</hi> Houſhold were all come together to hear the Word of God, and were converted, and ſpake with new Tongues, and did magnifie God, which could not be Infants.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, You may ſee that the Jaylors Houſhold were ſuch and not Infants; (<hi>Acts</hi> 16.34.) for the Text ſaith, that when the Jay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor had been Baptized, he <hi>brought them</hi> (viz. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silus</hi>) <hi>into his houſe, and ſet Meat before them, and rejoiced, and beleeved in God, with all his houſe:</hi> From whence we may ſee, that as the Text ſaith, that they were all baptized; even ſo it ſaith, that his houſhold did Rejoyce, and Beleeve in God; ſo then all that were baptized, were Beleevers, and not Infants.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, And the like was ſaid of the houſhold of <hi>Lydia,</hi> (<hi>Acts</hi> 16.40.) for ſaith the Text, <hi>They entered into the houſe of Lydia, and comforted the Brethren, and departed:</hi> which ſhews, That they that were baptized in <hi>Lydia</hi>'s houſe, were Brethren, which were capable
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:119763:16"/>
to receive comfort from the Apoſtles; which alſo ſheweth to us that they were not Infants, but Beleevers.</p>
                        <p>And Fourthly, As for the Houſhold of <hi>Stephanus,</hi> they are ſaid to <hi>addict</hi> (or give) <hi>themſelves to the adminiſtring unto the Saints,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.15. which cannot be underſtood to be Infants, for they are not capable ſo to do; take this word by the way, It cannot be proved that there were any Children in either of theſe Families, nor that any of them were Married Couples; but if it were both granted, yet it would not prove the matter, becauſe the word whole Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſholds, reſpects the Major part, or the like, and not every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidial perſon in the houſe.</p>
                        <p>And ſo I paſs to the next Objection, which is drawn from <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.18.</p>
                        <p>Object. 4. <hi>Go preach the Goſpel to all Nations, and baptize them; but Infants are part of the Nations,</hi> (ſaith my Antagoniſt) <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought te be baptized.</hi>

                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I Anſwer, ſaying; That I ſhall not trouble the Reader with a large Anſwer, becauſe I have already Anſwered this Text (alſo,) and therefore I ſhall give a ſhort word to prove that Infants cannot bear the Name Diſciple, and ſo leave it; becauſe it is the Anſwer to the whole Matter: And now that Children cannot bear the Name Diſciple, you may read, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. which ſaith, <hi>If any deny not himſelf, and take up his Croſs and follow Chriſt, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be his Diſciple:</hi> But Infants are not capable ſo to do; therefore cannot bear the Name of Chriſts Diſciples: And we know that the word Diſciple, is a Schollar; and I pray, can a perſon be called a Schollar of Chriſt, till he hath learned of Chriſt, or is at leaſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to learn of him: But an Infant is not a Schollar of Chriſt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not learned any thing of him, neither is he at preſent capable to learn any thing of him; therefore no Diſciple: And ſo I paſs to the next Objection; which is,</p>
                        <p>Object. 6. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Suffer little Children to come unto me; and he put his hands upon them, &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 19.14.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I Anſwer and ſay, That although this be the main place which hath been alleaged, and made uſe of by the Prieſts in their Baby-ſprinkling, yet I ſhall ſhew that this place is much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them if it be well underſtood; and that you may ſee it ſo to be, take notice, that Chriſts Diſciples which forbad theſe little Ones to be brought, were ſuch as were the Adminiſtrators of Baptiſm: which ſheweth, That there was no ſuch practiſe as to Baptize Infants, becauſe they would not then have forbid them to be brought.</p>
                        <p>And Secondly, That they were not brought to be baptized, is clear, becauſe the Parents brought them not to the Diſciples which were the baptizers.</p>
                        <p>And Thirdly, It is alſo clear, that they were not brought to be baptized, becauſe that Chriſt did for them as their Parents did deſire, and yet baptized them not, for he baptized none, but left that work to his Diſciples.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="21" facs="tcp:119763:17"/>But peradventure ſome may ſay, <hi>Wherefore were theſe Children brought to Chriſt?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>My Anſwer is, That it was to Cure them of ſome Diſeaſe, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, which did accompany them: And if any ſhould ask me what Reaſon I could give to prove it? I Anſwer, Theſe Two, or Three, in ſhort:</p>
                        <p>The Firſt is, Becauſe he was at that time in the work of Cure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all manner of Sickneſſes; as you may ſee, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.1, 2, 3.</p>
                        <p>And Secondly, His Way or Method in Curing, was, by putting his hands upon thoſe that had infirmity, as is clear from many Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but I ſhall cite but one Text at preſent (becauſe I ſtudy bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity) which is, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.40. in theſe words, <hi>Now when the Sun was ſetting, all they that had any ſick with diverſe Diſeaſes, brought them unto him, and he laid his Hands on every of them, and healed them:</hi> And for this end, they brought little Children that he might put his Hands upon them alſo; <hi>but his Diſciples</hi> (fearing their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter would be troubled with their crying, and the like) <hi>forbad them,</hi> (but Children being part of thoſe whom Chriſt Redeemed, he had as great love to them, as to the Men and Women) and ſaid, <hi>Suffer them to come, and do not hinder them:</hi> and giveth a weighty Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why he was willing to do them good; becauſe, ſaith he, <hi>of ſuch is the kingdom of God;</hi> therefore hinder them not of any benefit that may conduce to their good, or eaſe.</p>
                        <p>So then in the Firſt place you ſee that Chriſt was at that time about the work of Healing.</p>
                        <p>And Secondly, His Way in Healing, was by putting his Hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them whom he Healed.</p>
                        <p>And Thirdly, They brought the Children to him that he might put his Hands on them alſo.</p>
                        <p>And Fourthly, and Laſtly, Chriſt did convey a bleſſing unto them, by doing that to them for which they were brought, and yet baptized them not (as before ſaid) and that it was Healing of their Body, and not any ſpiritual thing, is clear; for as they were not capable to receive a ſpiritual bleſſing, ſo there was no eminent need of it, for they had right to the kingdom of God before, which is the greateſt bleſſing of all bleſſings. Add this, That in all likelihood their Parents did not mind to get for themſelves ſpiritual bleſſings, and much leſs for their Children; for if they had minded that ſo much as they ſhould have done, they would have followed Chriſt,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:119763:18"/>
and ſo have been of the Number of his Diſciples; but they were not his Diſciples, for his Diſciples forbad them; and indeed many did follow Chriſt which minded no ſpiritual good, but temporal only, as ſome to receive Cure for their infirmities, (for he went about doing good) and ſome <hi>followed him becauſe they eat of the Loaves, and were filled,</hi> Joh. 6.26. And thus much as to that Objection; Their Parents neither brought them to be Baptized, neither did Chriſt Baptize them, yet did do for them the ſame for which they were brought: And ſo I paſs to the next Objection; which is,</p>
                        <p>Object. 7. <hi>Circumciſion</hi> (ſay they) <hi>was a Tipe of Baptiſm, and Baptiſm came in the room and place of it.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I Anſwer, that neither of the Aſſertions are true: As Firſt, Circumciſion was never a Type of Baptiſm, but was a Type of the Circumciſion of the heart, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. and two laſt verſes; and as the Circumciſion of the fleſh did denote perſons heirs to the temporal Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſo the Circumciſion of the heart (<hi>viz.</hi> the vail of Ignorance and unbelief being taken away) doth entitle Perſons as heirs of that heavenly Land:</p>
                        <p>And Secondly, That Baptiſm came not in the room, or place of Circumciſion, is plain; Becauſe it is impoſſible for one thing to be ſaid to ſtand in the room and place of another, until the firſt is taken away; but Circumciſion and Baptiſm was practiſed both together for ſeveral years, and therefore one could not come in the room and place of the other: And ſo I paſs to the next falſe, or ſuppoſed, ground of Infants Baptiſm; which is,</p>
                        <p>Object. 8. <hi>There never was but one Covenant</hi> (ſaith my Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt) <hi>ſince the Fall, and Children were in that Covenant, and never caſt out, and therefore are to be baptized.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> And firſt, that there was two Covenants made with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> is clear; one in <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. and the other in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. And that God might make it plain, that he did make two ſeveral Covenants with <hi>Abraham,</hi> he ſets it forth by his Wife and Bond-woman, and the two Seeds, by their two Seeds; as ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.22. it is written, <hi>That Abraham had two Sons, one by a Bond-woman, and the other by the Free-woman;</hi> (and ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Theſe are the TWO Covenants:</hi> And alſo ſaith, (in <hi>verſ.</hi> 30.) <hi>Caſt out the Bond-woman, and her Son:</hi> From whence we take notice, that one Covenant, <hi>viz.</hi> the fleſhly one, and her ſeed, was to be caſt out, to give place to the ſpiritual one, and her Seed; which ſheweth, That there is two Covenants: And now that theſe are two in ſubſtance,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:119763:18"/>
as well as in Adminiſtrations; we may ſee the Apoſtle makes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction between the Covenant and the Ordinances, or the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of the Covenant; ſaying, Verily, the firſt Covenant <hi>had Ordinances of divine ſervice, and a worldly ſanctuary, &amp;c.</hi> And the Apoſtle further ſaith, That the Adminiſtrations of the ſecond Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was far better, it being ſpiritual Adminiſtrations, and the other carnal: but becauſe I have ſpoken before of this alſo, I ſhall be brief; ſaying, That carnal adminiſtrations cannot be the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a ſpiritual Covenant: For (as it is ſaid in another ſenſe) a good Tree cannot bring forth evil fruit; but the adminiſtrations of the Covenant was faulty and carnal by your own grant, how then could it be a ſpiritual Covenant? but that Covenant, and Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Seed was carnal and faulty, and muſt be caſt out, is clear; for the Scripture is plain, <hi>Caſt out the Bond-woman</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the firſt Covenant) <hi>and her Seed,</hi> and touch not her Ordinances or Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations, for they are carnal, and were but ſhadows of good things to come.</p>
                        <p>But ſaith my Antagoniſt, <hi>I can prove that there is Five Covenants as well as you can prove that there is Two; as one with Noah, and one with Abraham, and one with David, and the like.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I Anſwer, That was but a ſpeaking over again, or making known his Covenant to theſe ſeveral men; but that I may try you, I pray reſolve where the Scripture is written, that ſaith there is Five Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, or Three: the Scripture ſaith plainly, that there is Two, as a New, and an Old Covenant; a better, and a worſe; a firſt, and a ſecond; one faulty, and one perfect: but the Scripture no where ſaith that there is Five, nay or Three; ſo then you are ſeen and found to be at a loſs. And becauſe I have ſhewed formerly what theſe Two Covenants are, I paſs; only take notice of an Objection in this particular; which is, (ſay you)</p>
                        <p>Object. <hi>If the firſt Covenant was but an earthly one, with earthly bleſſings, what ſo great a hurt was it for the Jews to be cut off, and we Gentiles to be grafted in; and what is all our bleſſings temporal, for we are grafted into that ſtock from whence they were cut off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;</hi> ſay you.</p>

                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I Anſwer and ſay, That methinks here you ſhew your ſelf to be ſubtil or very ſimple; which of them (you are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of in this caſe) I ſhall not determine: but by your flouriſhing it appears to be ſimplicity; for <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, That <hi>a Fool rages and is confident:</hi> But did you indeed dream, that the ſtock from
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:119763:19"/>
whence the Jews was cut, was any of the Covenants, no ſuch thing ſurely; but the ſtock was <hi>Abraham:</hi> that is to ſay, The Ax was laid to the root of the Trees, to cut thoſe off that had not Faith, and to raiſe up another ſeed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt (nay, alſo as the Prophet before) had ſaid, and ſo did of ſtones (as it were, <hi>viz.</hi> the Gentiles) raiſe up Children to <hi>Abraham,</hi> for he was the ſtock, and not the Covenant, as you blindly did conceive; for as <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was cut off from <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe, ſo was <hi>Hagar</hi> alſo, and <hi>Iſaac</hi> was placed with <hi>Sarah</hi> in her room; for ſo ſoon as <hi>Sarah</hi> had brought forth Seed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> then <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Hagar</hi> muſt go both packing together, and <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Iſaac</hi> muſt only live with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham; Theſe are the Two Covenants:</hi> go learn what it means, that you may diſtinguiſh (better) between Stock and Covenant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother time: And ſo I paſs to the next and laſt Objection, which at preſent I ſhall make uſe of; which is,</p>

                        <p>And Secondly, Whereas it hath been affirmed, That there is no Example, or Command, for Women to Eat the Lords Supper: It's falſe; for there is a plain Precept, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. in theſe words, <hi>Let a man examine himſelf, and ſo let him eat;</hi> which is Precepto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: that is, He muſt examine himſelf, and ſo he muſt eat: The word <hi>(LET)</hi> is preceptory.</p>

That <hi>God made them Male and Female, and bleſſed them, and called THEIR name Adam:</hi> And thus you may ſee that God hath not left us to be guided by blind Conſequences, but hath left us a plain Rule, <hi>And as many as walk according to it, Peace be unto them, and Mercy upon all the Iſrael of God:</hi> So then there being many things practiſed pretending Worſhipping of God, and are vain, and yet not forbidden in ſo many words, Thou ſhalt not do it: So that theſe may ſee themſelves Anſwered, which hopes that Infants Baptiſm may be lawful, becauſe the Scripture no where ſaith, Thou ſhalt not Baptize thy Children; neither is it any where, Thou ſhalt not Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize thy Books, and Bells; and yet to do it, is to practiſe a Tradition of Man, in the Service of God, and unlawful: And thus I paſs from this Objection, and alſo from this Subject of Diſcourſe, and come to the next; which is that of Original Sin.</p>

                        <p>Which I ſhall prove by ſeveral plain and evident Reaſons drawn from the Scriptures; but before I ſpeak unto it, be informed what I mean by the ſecond Death, and that is the Lake which burneth with Fire and Brimſtone, which the Scripture calls the ſecond Death, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.14. for I do beleeve that the Wages of Sin is Death; but
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:119763:21"/>
as there is a twofold Covenant, ſo there is a twofold death, <hi>viz.</hi> a firſt, and ſecond Death: And that ſin in Paradice made <hi>Adam</hi> (and his) guilty of the firſt Death; but ſin againſt God, manifeſt in Chriſt, makes man guilty and liable to the ſecond death: And ſo I come to the Reaſons, to prove, That <hi>Adams</hi> ſin in Paradice, did not make him (and his) guilty of, and liable to the ſecond Death: And ſo to the Firſt Reaſon; which is,</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> In Anſwer to this Objection, Conſider theſe two things: The Firſt is, That <hi>one day with the Lord is as a thouſand years, and a thouſand years as one day,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.8. And <hi>Adam</hi> lived not a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, (nor no man ever did) and therefore <hi>Adam</hi> upon Gods account, died the ſame day, which day in Gods account is a thouſand years, which no man (as before ſaid) ever attained to; and ſo died,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:119763:21"/>
according to what God threatned within the compaſs or time of the Day, <hi>In the day that thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And Secondly, God that ſeeth all things at once, and calls things that ſhall be, as if they were, ſaw <hi>Adam</hi> dead the ſame hour that he ſinned, and he was as really dead in Gods account, as Chriſt was a Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world, or as <hi>Abrabam, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> living in a ſtate of Reſurrection when God appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Moſes</hi> in the buſh, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.30, 31, 32. And thus much briefly to the firſt Objection; the ſecond is,</p>
                        <p>Object. 2. <hi>What is meant by the Hebrew word</hi> (ſaith my Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt) <hi>in dying, thou ſhalt die?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I Anſwer and ſay, That ſo ſoon as <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned, he was mortalized, and in a dying condition, never continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one ſtay, but in the midſt of life ſubject to drop into the duſt, and ſo in being in a dying condition till he did return to duſt; it was ſaid, in dying he ſhould die; that is, he ſhould be dying till he was dead: and this is meant by the word, <hi>in dying thou ſhalt die:</hi> And ſo I paſs to the ſecond Reaſon, to prove, That <hi>Adams</hi> ſin did not make him guilty of, nor liable to the ſecond Death; which is,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> had no ſecond life promiſed (neither had he need of it) while he ſtood in his Innocency; and only a ſecond life preſuppoſeth a ſecond death; for a man cannot loſe more than he hath to looſe, which was but only one life, for the other came by Jeſus Chriſt, who did by death aboliſh death, and brought life and immortality to light; to which add this, That if Chriſt had not died, and alſo riſen from the dead, there had been no Reſurrection, and then having no ſecond life, there had been no ſecond death, <hi>for as by Man came Death, ſo by Man came the Reſurrection from the Dead:</hi> So then it was Gods love to give man life, and put him into that happy condition in Paradice, but it was mans ſin that brought death, and a deprivation from that happy eſtate and condition, it was Gods renewed love and unſearchable wiſdom and mercy, to bring man out of that Condition by a Reſurrection from the Dead to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond life and happy eſtate; but it is mans unſufferable perpetual wickedneſs, which brings upon him the ſecond death; <hi>for this is THE condemnation that Light is come into the world, and men love darkneſs rather than light,</hi> Joh. 3. And thus we ſee that there was no ſecond life in Paradiſe to be loſt, and therefore that ſin purchaſed
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:119763:22"/>
not the ſecond death. And ſo I paſs to the Third Reaſon, to prove, That <hi>Adams</hi> ſin did not make him guilty of the ſecond death; which is,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Thirdly, Becauſe if <hi>Adam</hi> had been guilty of the ſecond death, and that was the death intended, where it is ſaid, <hi>in dying thou ſhalt die;</hi> then Gods Juſtice had not been ſatisfied unleſs <hi>Adam</hi> had died the ſecond death, (and all that were made guilty by that ſin;) but none did die the ſecond death for that ſin committed in Paradiſe; although the firſt death, or a change, (which is as death) paſſeth upon the Righteous, as well as the Wicked; and that if they had been made guilty of the ſecond death, they ſhould alſo have died the ſecond death, is, becauſe the Scripture ſaith, That <hi>God will by no means clear the guilty,</hi> Exod. 34.7. But if God did ſend Chriſt to take away the ſecond death, ſo, that many taſte it not, and none taſte it for that ſin committed in Paradiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. then, God did uſe a means to clear the guilty, and ſo his word is Yea and Nay, and not Yea and Amen; but it being the guilt of the firſt death, God ſpares not his own pretious Ones; but <hi>we muſt needs die, and be as water ſpilt upon the ground, which cannot be gathered; neither doth God reſpect the Perſon of any man, yet he hath uſed a means that his baniſhed ſhall not be for ever expelled from him,</hi> 2 Sam. 14.14. and in this ſenſe man muſt die for that ſin, and ſo Juſtice ſatisfied, and ſo gives way to Mercy: And thus I paſs to the Fourth Reaſon, to prove, That the ſin committed in Paradiſe, made not <hi>Adam</hi> guilty and liable to the ſecond death; which is,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. Fourthly, Becauſe it argues a change in God in what he hath abſolutely Decreed; for God did abſolutely decree, That if <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> did eat, that he ſhould ſurely die; and <hi>Adam</hi> did eat: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if that death that God threatned to inflict upon <hi>Adam</hi> were the ſecond death, (as ſome ſay) then God changeth in what he did ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely Decree; for <hi>Adam</hi> and his, are not damned for that ſin, as is clear from many texts of Scripture, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Add this alſo, It makes God to be a Liar, and the Devil to ſpeak the Truth, which were blaſphemy to aſſert: for as God ſaid, That if <hi>Adam</hi> eat, he ſhould die; ſo the Devil ſaid, They ſhould not die: now if this be the ſecond Death, there mentioned, and <hi>Adam</hi> not die that death, and yet did eat, judge who it was that ſpoke the Truth; but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt death that God intended in that place, Gods Word was fulfilled, <hi>Adam</hi> did ſo die; and ſo Gods Word was true, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil was a liar from the beginning: But ſaith my Antagoniſt, <hi>God
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:119763:22"/>
may alter in his threatnings, as in Nineveh, and Hezekiah, and the like;</hi> but my Antagoniſt knows well that I have given him ſuch an Anſwer unto it, that he is not able to Anſwer; time will not ſuffer me hear to repeat it; read my former Book: only this in ſhort, Conſider that before God ſent <hi>Jonah</hi> to <hi>Nineveh,</hi> to proclaim forty dayes and <hi>Nineveh</hi> ſhall be deſtroyed; he did decree and declare it, That in what inſtant he ſpake, as touching the deſtroying of a People, if they did repent, then he alſo would repent of the evil that he ſaid he would bring upon them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. but <hi>Nineveh</hi> did repent, and proclaim a Faſt, and therefore God was engaged, according to his Word, not to deſtroy them; but the caſe was not ſo with <hi>Adam:</hi> And alſo <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did repent, and humbled himſelf with mourning; and ſo God was conſtrained to hear, and anſwer his deſire, according to his Word. Hence he had Mercy on the Houſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> when he humbled himſelf; yet God changeth not in what he hath Decreed, but doth Decree to alter the Diſpenſation of Mercy and Juſtice, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Creatures actings: And thus I leave the Objection, having Anſwered it before, and alſo the Reaſon; and come now to the Fifth Reaſon, to prove, That <hi>Adams</hi> ſin did not make him guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of, or liable to the ſecond death; which is,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. Fifthly, Becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> was but a natural man, and had but a natural life, and yet ſhould have lived for ever, by eating of the Tree of Life, had he not ſinned; but when he had ſinned, and thereby deprived himſelf of the Tree of Life, then (in reſpect of Mortality) he had no prehemenence above the Beaſt of the field, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.18, 19, 20. And that he was but a natural man, read 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.44, 45. Moreover know, (as aforeſaid) That there was no Promiſe of a ſecond life, till after the Fall; and therefore God could not threaten man with the loſs of that which he had not given, or promiſed to give unto him; and therefore that ſin in Paradiſe could not make <hi>Adam</hi> guilty of the ſecond death, becauſe he never had a ſecond life, or a promiſe of it in the ſtate of Innocency; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſinned he againſt the new Covenant, or God manifeſt in Chriſt, which brought the ſecond life, and therefore not guilty of the ſecond death: And ſo I paſs to the Sixth and laſt Reaſon, to prove, That <hi>Adams</hi> ſin made him not guilty of the ſecond death, neither was that death intended by God, either in the threatning, or in the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="32" facs="tcp:119763:23"/>
                           <hi>Reaſ,</hi> 6. Sixthly, and Laſtly, Becauſe that death which entered into the world by <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, paſſed and reigned over all men from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Rom. 5.12, 13, 14. in which time lived <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> and ſeveral others; over whom the ſecond death had no power: and yet that death which <hi>Adam</hi> purchaſed by his ſin, paſſed upon all men, and alſo reigned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them; which ſheweth, That the wages of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin in Paradiſe, was but the firſt death; for that death <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and the reſt, taſted of; and ſo it reigned from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> over them that had not ſinned after the ſimilitude of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that is againſt a preſcript Law upon penalty of death, which proveth, That it was <hi>Adams</hi> ſin (and we in him) which brought that firſt death upon us; but as for the ſecond death, it reigned not over thoſe holy men that lived between <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Moſes;</hi> neither doth it paſs or reign over any, till after the Reſurrection, and the eternal Judgement; for THEN ſhall the Wicked be caſt into the Lake of Fire, which is the ſecond Death, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12, 13, 14. So then that Death which entered into the World for <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, the which all taſted of from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> is ſeen to be no other death, but what God threatned and pronounced in the ſentence; namely, <hi>Duſt thou art, and to Duſt thou ſhalt return;</hi> even the firſt death: And thus I paſs to the Anſwer of ſome few Objections offered by my Antagoniſt; And the firſt is a Quotation, <hi>Romans</hi> 5.16. with <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.1.</p>
                        <p>Object. 1. <hi>The offence of one ſin came upon all to Condemnation;</hi> (i.e.) <hi>Damnation; compared with</hi> Rom. 8.1.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> This Quotation hath been already Anſwered; yet I ſhall ſpeak a few words to it in this place; which is, That the word Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation is uſed for the firſt death, as well as for the ſecond; as in <hi>Luke</hi> 23.40. And it is uſed indefinitely in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no Condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> it may be read, there is therefore no death to them that are in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.</p>
                        <p>But you will ſay, <hi>Yea, the Righteous do die the firſt death.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But if you take notice, <hi>Paul</hi> is ſhewing in that place, that Chriſt delivereth from that body of death, and in Chriſt we have victory, and ſhall conquer the grave; and ſo in that ſenſe, there is no death to the Righteous: for the word <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:119763:23"/>
only ſay the words differ, but give no Reaſon worth a figg to prove it; only you ſay, that one ſin was againſt Man, and the other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God: your meaning is, The Malefactors ſin was only againſt Man, and <hi>Adams</hi> againſt God. But I pray be ſerious; do you not think that the Malefactor ſinned againſt God? Or is not Murder, or Stealing, or the like, a ſin againſt God? What means this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, if it argue not groſs ignorance, I am very much miſtaken in my Judgement: But looking a little forth, I find you citing an old Argument of Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi>'s; which is,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That ſin that is committed againſt an infinite God, deſerveth an infinite puniſhment; but Adams ſin was ſuch;</hi> Ergo, <hi>Where art thou Hammon,</hi> ſaith my Antagoniſt?</p>
                        <p>To which I Anſwer and ſay, That it is not our Queſtion what <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> ſin deſerved, but what the puniſhment was, which God was pleaſed to inflict upon <hi>Adam</hi> for that tranſgreſſion, the which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have proved to be but the firſt death, and ſuch like puniſhment: And alſo I do ſay, and have ſaid, That <hi>Adams</hi> ſin was ſo great that it cauſed him to loſe all that God gave him, and to lay his honor in the duſt, and yet notwithſtanding, it made him no more guilty of the ſecond death, than the Beaſts which touched the Mountain (and therein offended God) and muſt be thruſt thorow with a Dart, and yet loſt no more than what it had to loſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.20. And if I ſhould deny your Major Propoſition, you would be troubled to prove it, becauſe Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> hath not done it already for you: And whereas you ask, (by way of a jear,) Where I am? I could tell you, That I may be found (through Mercy) at my Native place; although as for your part, if I ſhould ask where you are, (as in reference to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your Judgement or Habitation) men know not, and it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, you care not (they ſhould know) where you are to be found; but this by degreſſion: I paſs, and come to the Third Objection; which is, ſay you,</p>
                        <p>Object. 3. <hi>If Adam brought but a temporal death on men, then Chriſt died but a temporal death to ſatisfie God.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> That Chriſt did not die the ſecond death; that is to ſay, Chriſt did not ſuffer in the Lake of Fire and Brimſtone, is clear; for if he had, he had been irrecoverable: Take notice, that there is a great gulph fixed, ſo that thoſe that once come into that place (take heed) cannot go thence any more: Fie, fie, what did Chriſt ſuffer in Hell with the Devil and Damned ſpirits! No ſurely, although your Creed have taught you ſo to beleeve: And whereas you ſay,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:119763:24"/>
That <hi>Chriſt was made a Curſe for us;</hi> it is acknowledged that he was hanged upon a Tree; and <hi>curſed is every one that hangeth upon a tree:</hi> But I hope that it is but a temporal curſe; for otherwiſe, there be many of the Saints that have ſo ſuffered, and then are in a curſed eſtate, and condition, if your opinion be true; but it is not.</p>
                        <p>And whereas you ſay, That my <hi>Opinion makes Children but a little beholding to Chriſt; for if he had not come, they had died but a temporal death, and ſo they do ſtill.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To which I Anſwer and ſay, It is true, that if Chriſt had not come, they had died but a temporal death (for that ſin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in Paradice) and alſo that they do die a temporal death not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, and yet your Concluſion falſe; for Chriſt is very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial to them notwithſtanding; ſo that if I had the tongue of men and Angels, I could not expreſs it as I ſhould do: Time is pretious, take this in ſhort, That Chriſt brings them to a reſurrection, and brings all the glory that is ſpoken of in the Scripture, to be there por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the other ſide of the grave; I could be very large, but I muſt ſpeak now by figures (as we ſay) and not by words at length, and leave you and the Reader to enlarge it in your underſtanding: And for as much as you deſire me to inform you what ſhould have become of the ſoul of man; I ſhall ſhew you my opinion about it, and the grounds and reaſons from the Scripture, and if I be miſtaken in it, I hope ſome ſympathyzing tender heart will be as ready to inform me better in it, as the captious Spirit will be to cavil at it; and I hope I ſhall receive ſuch information with humility of mind, and thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart; and ſo I paſs to the Subject of Diſcourſe, namely, Mans Mortality.</p>

But leaving theſe things, I ſhall come ſuddenly to the Reaſons, and then anſwer ſome Objections; but firſt ſee ſome Scriptures which proveth that Man is wholly mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; and firſt ſee the words of the Wiſe man, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3.19, 20. in theſe words; <hi>For what befalleth the ſons of men befalleth Beaſts, even one thing befalleth them, as the one dyeth ſo dyeth the other, yea they have all one breath, ſo that man hath no preheminence above a beaſt, for all is vanity, all go to one place, all are of the duſt, and return to duſt again;</hi> Agreeable to the Word of the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>Duſt thou art, and to duſt thou ſhalt return;</hi> and this is alſo further amplified, by <hi>John</hi> 4.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. in theſe words, <hi>For there is hope of a tree if he be cut down that it will sprout again, and the tender branches thereof, will not ceaſe, though the root thereof wax old in the ground, and the ſtock thereof die in the earth, yet tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the deſcent of water, it will bud and bring forth branches like a plant; but man dyeth and waſteth away, ye man giveth up the Ghoſt, and where is he? as the waters fall from the Sea, and the floods decay and dry up, ſo man lyeth down; for we muſt needs die and be as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter spilt upon the ground, that cannot be gathered; neither doth God reſpect the perſon of any man, yet he hath uſed a means, that his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed ſhall not be for ever expelled from him.</hi> From whence we may ſee, that the eſtate of man is compared to the floods that are dryed up; that is, become as it were nothing, and is ſo to remain until the reſurrection, for by ſin and death we are baniſhed from the Lord, yet he hath uſed a means, namely, to bring us forth again at the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, that his baniſhed ſhould not be for ever kept from him; but if the righteous go to heaven ſo ſoon as they die, how are they ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed from him? and become as water ſpilt upon the ground?

                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Firſt becauſe Chriſt dyed ſoul and body, to purchaſe our ſouls and bodies from the grave; and if Chriſts ſoul dyed, it was really to that end that our ſouls might not lie in the grave, and if we had dyed only in body, then Chriſt had dyed only in body, but the whole man being mortal and returned to duſt; Chriſt alſo poured out his ſoul to death, and made his ſoul an offering for ſin, as ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10. <hi>When thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin; he ſhall ſee his ſeed,</hi> (mark that) <hi>he ſhall prolong his dayes, and the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand,</hi> 12. <hi>Becauſe he hath poured out his ſoul to death, and he was numbred with the ſtrangers, and he bore the ſins of many, &amp;c.</hi> From hence we ſee, that Chriſts <hi>SO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L</hi> dyed, that ours might live again, and not be left in the grave; which proveth that our ſouls are mortal and die; and ſo I paſs to the ſecond reaſon to prove, That the whole man is mortal; which is;</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Secondly, becauſe if mans body be mortal, and that die, and his ſoul immortal &amp; that live, then man hath two lives, &amp; two diſtinct Beings, which is not; for if there be two diſtinct lives, and two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Beings, then <hi>Adam</hi> was two diſtinct Creatures; and then it cannot be ſaid, that as by the offence of <hi>ONE,</hi> Judgment came upon all men to condemnation, for <hi>Adam</hi> upon that account was <hi>TWO</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct beings, having two diſtinct lives; but man having but one life, the whole man muſt be mortal, or the whole man immortal, and that the whole man is mortal, the Scriptures and our experience doth witneſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Again Thirdly, Becauſe otherwiſe Chriſt had done <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> wrong by raiſing him from the dead, for if his Soul had been in Heaven four dayes, and then Chriſt fetched it from thence, it was ſo far from an act of love (to him whom Chriſt ſo well loved) that it was great prejudice; and alſo I ſtrange that <hi>Lazarus</hi> did not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:119763:26"/>
one tittle of the glory of Heaven, if he had been there the four daies that he was dead; but I remember that the Apoſtle ſaith, That <hi>David is not yet aſcended into Heaven:</hi> but if Souls departed are there, he alſo would have been there, and Chriſt would not have brought <hi>Lazarus</hi> from thence, <hi>But no man hath aſcended</hi> yet <hi>to Heaven, but he that came down from Heaven, even the Son of man which is in Heaven, John</hi> 3. And ſo I paſs to the Fourth Reaſon: which is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. Becauſe the Scripture ſaith, that immortality only dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in Chriſt; but if every man have an immortal Soul dwelling in him, then immortality dwelleth in every man: but the Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nieth that, and ſaith, that immortality dwelleth in none but in Chriſt, or only in Chriſt, which is one and the ſame; and that you may ſee this proved to you, read 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.16. in theſe words, <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>Which in his times ſhall ſhew who is the bleſſed and only Potentate, the KING of KINGS, and LORD of LORDS, who ONLY hath immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dwelling in the light, that no man can approach unto;</hi> ſo then, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality dwelleth only in Chriſt, and the glory of man is as the flour of graſs, for they dye, and in the ſame day their thoughts periſh; which ſheweth that man is wholly mortal; and ſo I paſs to the Fifth Reaſon: which is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. Becauſe the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.23. That <hi>every li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſubſtance, was deſtroyed</hi> (in the floud) <hi>in which was the breath of life,</hi> (ſave <hi>Noah,</hi> and thoſe that were with him in the Ark) and then if the Soul have life, or be a living ſubſtance, it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, as <hi>Joſhua</hi> deſtroyed every living Soul with the edge of the Sword, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 11. The concluſion is this; that which may be deſtroyed is mortal; but the Soul may be deſtroyed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mortal.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 6. Again Sixtly, Becauſe that which is the mortal part of man bears the name living Soul: which ſheweth, that the whole man is mortal, for the Scripture ſaith, <hi>That God made man out of the duſt of the earth, and breathed upon him the breath of life, and he BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CAME a living ſoul;</hi> (mark) it was not a living Soul inferred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, but by being breathed upon, the man that was made of the duſt of the earth, <hi>BECAME</hi> a living ſoul, (mark the word <hi>BE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CAME</hi> a living ſoul) now it was not the breath that became a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Soul, but it was the man which became a living ſoul: and if the breath be not that which is called the living ſoul, what is man when his breath returns to God that gave it? ſurely it is a dead lump;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:119763:26"/>
and when <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of mortality, and immortality, he argues mortality from the very word <hi>LIVING SO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L,</hi> ſaying, <hi>The firſt man was made a</hi> LIVING SOUL, <hi>and the ſecond Adam a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Spirit; the firſt man was of the earth earthy,</hi> and ſo forth: Theſe things conſidered, ſheweth that the <hi>LIVING SO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the firſt man) was mortal, and the quickning Spirit (<hi>viz.</hi> the Second man Chriſt Jeſus) was he that only had immortality dwelt in him; ſo then, if mortality be attributed to that which is called the <hi>LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VING SO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L,</hi> then it is plain that the whole man is mortal; and ſo I paſs to the Seventh Reaſon: which is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſon</hi> 7. Becauſe if the Soul dye not, then it abideth alone, and is unfruitful, for <hi>it is not quickened unleſs it dye,</hi> as ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, and if it dye not, then is not Chriſt the firſt fruits of it, for Chriſt is only the firſt fruits of them that ſleep; and indeed it was no argument of weight that Chriſt uſed to the <hi>Saduces,</hi> to prove the Reſurrection, if the ſoul dye not, for he ſaith, <hi>God is not the God of the dead, but of the living, for all live to him;</hi> or in his account, meaning by a Reſurrection: but if the Soul dye not for a time, how could Chriſt have uſed the words, all live to him, to prove a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: for if it had been ſo that the ſoul dyed not, then they might have ſaid, it is true, their ſouls live to God, and ſo it had been no argument at all to prove the Reſurrection; but Chriſt bringeth it to prove the Reſurrection, implying, that there is no other living to God after this life is ended, but in a Reſurrection; which brings me to the Eight and laſt Reaſon to prove Man wholly mortal; which is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 8. Becauſe as thoſe that go to the Grave cannot praiſe God, ſo all our glory in the enjoyment of our inheritance is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to us, that we ſhall receive it at the Revelation of Chriſt: or that God will reward us at the Reſurrection of the Juſt: and that was the main comfort of the godly in the time of their afflictions, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7, 8, 9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8, 9, 10. And it was <hi>Pauls</hi> comfort at his death, ſaying, <hi>Henceforth is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſneſs, which God the righteous Judge will give to me AT THAT DAY;</hi> not before, take notice there is a time limited. <hi>For the hour is coming that all that are in the graves ſhall come forth;</hi> and then <hi>thoſe that are wiſe ſhall ſhine as the firmament;</hi> add this, that <hi>if the dead riſe not, then ſuch as are fallen aſleep in Chriſt are periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and the Saints of all men moſt miſerable; but if there be ſuch a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:119763:27"/>
thing as a ſoul of the righteous which goeth to God; how can it be, that if the dead riſe not, that the Saints of all men are the moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, for they are in felicity whether the body riſe yea or nay? moreover, doubtleſs this opinion of the ſoul being immortal, hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got all theſe vain errors, as prayer over the dead, and Purgatory, for that is the received opinion, that men be not in their full joy, or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment till the Reſurrection; and ſome are ſo bould as to deny the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection by reaſon of this conceit; and I could ſhew, that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then in chief have been the authors of this Opinion; but there be many things that I am fain to omit becauſe of time, and offer that only which is drawn from Scripture; and thus having briefly given you theſe few Reaſons, in the next place I ſhall inſtance that which men call the <hi>Soul,</hi> and ſhew that that is mortal, omitting the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Stoick, and <hi>Democritus,</hi> and <hi>Plato,</hi> and the like; I ſhall ſpeak ſomewhat of the received Opinion what the Soul is: and that is,</p>
                     <p>Some ſay it is the Underſtanding part of Man; the which if ſo, then all are born without Souls, and many never have any; Firſt, That Children have not underſtanding at the time of their Birth, I think all will grant if the Scripture did not prove it; and alſo that there be many that never have underſtanding, but are natural fools; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the Underſtanding part of Man be the Soul, then thoſe that have no underſtanding have no Soul, and they that have a Soul, if underſtanding be the Soul, it dieth with the man, for in the ſame day their thoughts periſh, and the dead underſtand not, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.5. And if the faculties of man be underſtood to be the Soul, then it is eaſie to prove them Temperatures and Mortal, becauſe they are ſubject to increaſe and diminiſh as the Creator is diſpoſed; and madneſs (that may happen to man by ſome obſtruction in the body) quite mollifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them; ſo then theſe things conſidered, we may ſee that the whole man is mortal; time would fail me to write the particular things appertaining to this ſubject of Diſcourſe, and therefore I ſhall paſs to the anſwer of ſome few Objections, which may comprehend the whole; but by the way give me leave to ſhew you a glimpſe of what the Scripture calls the Soul, in which you may ſee how many things bear the name of Soul in Scripture; and firſt it is taken for God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.28. it is taken for the heart, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.1. for the eyes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.17. for the head, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 16.10. for the ſtomack, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.7. for hunger, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.30. for the whole man, <hi>Lev.</hi> 7.20. <hi>Acts</hi> 7.14. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1. Theſe, and many more in
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:119763:27"/>
Scripture is called by the name of Soul; but I come now to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections; which is,</p>

                        <hi>Object.</hi> 1. <hi>Fear not him that can kill the body, but cannot kill the Soul,</hi> Mat. 10.28. implying that there is a ſoul which cannot be kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is the moſt material Text that I know of to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: but <hi>Luke</hi> which is the moſt exact Writer, hath recorded it thus, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.4, 5. <hi>And I ſay unto you my friends, be not afraid of them that can kill the body, and afterwards have no more that they can do; but fear him which after he hath killed, hath power to caſt into hell, yea I ſay unto you fear him;</hi> which ſheweth to us, man can only deſtroy the body which is mortal, and muſt dye; but God can deſtroy both the body which is mortal, and alſo caſt the whole man into hell when it is immortal after the Reſurrection, and ſo he above all is to be feared: and that this in ſhort is the meaning of the words, is evident, becauſe the ſoul hath been killed by man, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 10.35. but after the Reſurrection none can deſtroy it but God; and ſo I paſs to the next Objection; which is,</p>

that day; &amp; not to me only, but unto them alſo that love his appearance.</hi> From whence we may learn, that the godly mans glory is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon him at the time of Chriſts appearance, and not at the time of death, only at the time of death it is laid up ſure, (for thoſe that have dyed in the faith) <hi>

                     <p>To which I anſwer and ſay, that it is but a Parable and was no more, ſo then what is ſpoke of the trees, in <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.8. in theſe words, <hi>And the trees went forth on a time to annoint a King over them, and they ſaid unto the Olive tree, raign thou over us; but the Olive tree ſaid; ſhall I leave my fatneſs, &amp;c.</hi> Moreover conſider the Obſurdities that follow, (if that be any more than a Parable.)</p>

From theſe and many ſuch like Scriptures, we are taught, that both the reward of the righteous and the Wicked, are reſerved till the appearance of the Lord Jeſus at the day of Judgment; And as touching Hell, I have formerly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that it is not in being till the day of Judgment, and that the Devils place is in the ayr, he being called the Prince thereof; and that alſo he compaſſeth the earth by walking to and fro in it; but if he were in Hell, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Lake) he could not ſo do, for from thence none can poſſibly come, when they are once there; but let no ſottiſh ſoul therefore take liberty to ſin, for know (as I before have ſaid) that ſo ſoon as a wicked man dyeth, he ſhall be brought to Judgment, and then receive a juſt recompence of reward; that is to ſay, in his account it will be preſent to him, there being no time or remembrance of time amongſt the dead; ſo that the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his death and reſurrection, will be no more to him, then the time was to him before he was born, that is to ſay, from the Creation of the world to the time of his being; although it was a great time, yet to him it was no time, no not a moment, neither will it be after death a moment of time, till the Reſurrection, in the account of the dead; therefore take not liberty to ſin, for if thou do, thy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſlumbereth not, but haſteneth, and will fall on thee in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, take heed; and thus I paſs to the laſt Scripture mentioned,</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Luke.</hi> 23.43. <hi>I ſay unto thee to day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To which I anſwer and ſay, That although I have anſwered this
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:119763:29"/>
text before in another place, yet I ſhall ſpeak ſomewhat to it here; and firſt conſider, That Chriſt was not that day in heaven, nor many dayes after, (as I before have ſaid) for Chriſt was three dayes both ſoul and body in the grave, as you may read, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.10. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.10, 12. and <hi>Acts.</hi> 2.31. And after he was riſen from the dead, and amongſt his Diſciples, <hi>He ſaid touch me not, for I am not yet aſcended unto my Father, John</hi> 20.17. Which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, That Chriſt was not in Paradiſe himſelf that day, in which the words were ſpoken.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it cannot be proved, That the Thief was dead the ſame day, neither is it likely that he was, becauſe that Chriſt was not dead himſelf till after the ninth hour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.46, 47, 48, 50. And if Chriſt dyed not till after the ninth hour, then there was not three hours more remaining of the day, and after this time, (and in all likely-hood very neer to the end of the day) they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaught <hi>Pilate,</hi> that their legs might be broke, that they might be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down from the Croſs, becauſe the preparation of the Sabbath drew neer; that they might not hang on the Croſs upon the Sabbath day, for that day was an high day with the Jewes; and the text ſaith, that they brake the legs of the firſt, and of the ſecond, and when they found Chriſt dead already, they brake not his legs; the which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth clearly, that the other two Malefactors were not dead; and alſo take notice, that the death of the Croſs was a languiſhing death, and it being unutial, or unlawful to bring the priſoners from their execution to priſon again; therefore that they might not make an eſcape but die according to the Law, they brake their legs, and then by their ſo doing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there could be no means of eſcape, but they muſt die; yet it doth not follow, that they did die the ſame day, for men may lie a whole day, nay they may lie dayes with their legs broken, before they die; and I do dare preſume to ſay, that they were both alive very neer the end of that day, and had nothing inflicted upon them to ſhorten their lives, but being nailed thorow their hands and feet, and their legs broken; and I dare preſume, that many lie lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then they had to lie of that day, that have been far more deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately wounded: Furthermore I dare preſume to ſay, that no man living can prove that the Malefactors were dead the ſame day, and if it cannot be proved that they were dead that day, it cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the ſoul of the penitent Thief was that day in heaven: moreover, conſider Chriſt did not tell the Thief that his <hi>SO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L</hi> ſhould be with him in Paradiſe; but ſaith, <hi>thou ſhalt be with me,</hi>
                        <pb n="46" facs="tcp:119763:30"/>
not thy <hi>SO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L,</hi> but thou, (<hi>viz.</hi> thou Thief, or thou) Man, ſhalt be with me) in Paradiſe, which was not ſo; then you ſee that Chriſt was not aſcended himſelf, but he poured out his ſoul to death, and that lay in the grave, although God left it not there.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it cannot be proved, that the Thief was dead that day, if there were ſuch a thing as the ſoul aſcending into Heaven at the time of death.</p>
                     <p>And thirdly, the text doth not ſay, the <hi>SO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L</hi> ſhall be with Chriſt, but thou (<hi>i. e.</hi> thou) Man or Thief, (as before ſaid) ſhall be with me.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things conſidered, what may we underſtand of the text, which ſaith, <hi>verily I ſay unto thee, to day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To which I anſwer and ſay, (as I before have ſaid) that whereas Chriſt ſaith, <hi>to day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe,</hi> is but to give the Thief aſſurance of his ſalvation; for his petition or requeſt is, that the Lord would remember him when he came into his Kingdome; and Chriſt to put him out of doubt, and to adminiſter comfort and aſſurance unto him, ſaith, <hi>I ſay unto thee, to day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe;</hi> as if he ſhould have ſaid to him, thou deſired me to remember thee when I come into my Kingdome, but to put thee out of doubt, I will tell thee at preſent, (or to day) to thy comfort, that thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe: Doth it follow therefore becauſe Chriſt giveth him a promiſe that day of heaven, that therefore he muſt be in heaven the ſame day; it was well for him that he had a promiſe of it that day, that thereby he may enjoy it when <hi>David,</hi> (who is not aſcended into heaven) ſhall enjoy it, with the reſt of the godly at that day before ſpoken of: ſo then that day was but the day of promiſe, but the day of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is yet to come; namely, when the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed, and till that time we are to wait for it, becauſe all the Saints ſhall be made perfect, and enjoy their inheritance together. And thus I paſs from this Obſection, and haſten to the concluſion of this Subject of diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 5. But if it be objected, that <hi>the ſouls of them that are ſlain cry under rhe Alter Table, Rev.</hi> 6.10.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, by Alter Table, we are to underſtand a place of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and by Souls crying, we are to underſtand the blood of the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:119763:30"/>
Saints crying for vengeance, for it is blood that cries for vengeance; and that the ſoul is (in ſome places) to be underſtood blood, is clear; becauſe the life or blood, is to be underſtood all one in many places: and ſo it is ſaid that Chriſt made his ſoul an offering for ſin; and that is to be underſtood, his life, or more properly his blood, <hi>for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blood there is no remiſſion of ſins:</hi> And alſo I have before ſhewed, that the Greek word Soul, bears ſuch a ſignification as blood, and if ſo, it is very proper for the ſouls, (<hi>viz.</hi> blood) to cry for vengeance, for ſo did <hi>Abels</hi> blood cry for vengeance againſt <hi>Cain;</hi> and alſo Chriſts blood doth cry for vengeance againſt ſuch as are guilty of it, by trampling it under foot, although it doth ſpeak (for the penitent) better things then the blood of <hi>Abel.</hi> And thus we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that ſixt chapter of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> that after the red Horſe, (and he that ſate upon him with the great Sword) had took peace from the earth; then <hi>John</hi> ſaw the blood of the juſt ones lying under the Alter Table; that is, the place where they were made a ſacrifice, or where they offered up their blood or lives a ſacrifice for Chriſts ſake, and the teſtimony of a good conſcience; and that (<hi>viz.</hi> blood) cryed for vengeance; and this is that which <hi>John</hi> ſaw and declared, when he ſaith, <hi>I ſaw the ſouls which were ſlain for the word of God, and the Teſtimony which they held.</hi> And ſo I paſs to the next and laſt objection, which is drawn from the 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18, 19. in theſe words.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> 6. <hi>By which he went and preached, to the Spirits in Priſon; therefore there is an immortal ſoul.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwer and ſay, that the meaning of this place is no other, but that the ſpirit of Chriſt did preach to the old world in <hi>Noahs</hi> dayes, or Chriſt by the ſame ſpirit (wherewith he was quickned) preached in the dayes of <hi>Noah</hi> to thoſe that are now dead or in Priſon; for the word Priſon is to be underſtood, a place of ſecurity, to ſecure perſons for the day of Judgment, to be either acquitted and juſtfied, or condemned and executed; and this agrees with <hi>Revel</hi> 20.13. where it is ſaid, (as at a Goal delivery) <hi>That the Sea and death, and the grave, delivered up the dead which were in them, and they were all judged according to their works.</hi> And whereas it is read Hell in our Tranſlations, it is meant the grave, for ſo it ſhould be read; the which if you queſtion it, you may read the margent note, and ſee it ſo read there: The like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion there is in <hi>John</hi> 31.8. ſpeaking of death, ſaith, <hi>There the priſoners reſt together, the ſmal and great are there, and the ſervant is
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:119763:31"/>
free from his Maſter, verſe</hi> 19. So then it was the ſame ſpirit, that which raiſed Chriſt from the dead; that preached in the dayes of <hi>Noah;</hi> obſerve this, (and I paſs to the concluſion) That it was not the quickned that preached to the Spirits, who were diſobedient in the dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> (and now in priſon) but it was the quickner, there is the myſtery of the text; mark well I have a few words more, and ſo I ſhall leave this Subject of Diſcourſe; which is,</p>
                     <p>Firſt a few words (in particular) to my Antagoniſt, who ſaith, That <hi>the ſoul is immortal, becauſe it was created after Gods I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Although he hath contradicted himſelf (ſadly) in what he holds, if he own what he hath written in the 13 and 14 and 15 pages of his former Book; intituled, <hi>The condition of Adam in Paradiſe;</hi> where he ſaith, that <hi>the whole man begets the whole man,</hi> and alſo (elſe where) ſaith, that <hi>if Adam did not beget the whole man, viz.</hi> the ſoul) <hi>then did he not beget a perfect and compleat creature, as the beaſts do in their kind;</hi> Page 12.</p>
                     <p>To which I anſwer and ſay, and firſt how my Antagoniſt will be able to prove the ſoul (as he calls it) to be that which was created after Gods Image, I know not, for the Scripture ſaith. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. that <hi>God ſaid, let us make Man after our Image,</hi> (not, let us make a ſoul after our Image;) and when God had made man out of the duſt of the earth, (after his own Image) then he breathed into him the breath of life, (and then that which was made after Gods Image, <hi>e. i.</hi> the Man) became a living ſoul; ſo that it was not a living ſoul that was put into man, but the man that was made of the duſt of the earth, became a living ſoul by Gods breathing into him, (mark that.) But no more of this, becauſe I have ſpoken of it already in this Subject of Diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>But (ſecondly,) cannot the ſoul be mortal, becauſe it is after Gods Image, how then came Chriſt to die if not mortal, and yet he was after Gods Image, for he was the expreſs Image of his Fathers Perſon, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. and yet notwithſtanding, was ſo mortal as to die body and ſoul, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.12. And alſo the Apoſtle ſaith, that the <hi>Man</hi> (not ſoul) <hi>is the Image and glory of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.7. and yet man dyeth; from whence you may ſee your ſelf anſwered, and your reaſon or argument nothing worth. And as to the other matter <hi>(viz.)</hi> the ſouls Parentage, I have received much light in it, although not by my Antagoniſt, for I do ſuppoſe that he wrote things from others, (for arguments ſake) which was not his own
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:119763:31"/>
judgment, and therefore he ſpake ſo cloudily; but that which cauſed me to examine the matter more niſely, was the words of a beloved brother in a private conference between him and my ſelf, about the buſineſs, in the which (amongſt the reſt of his diſcourſe) he offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this thing as an obſurdity which would follow, if the ſouls pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage was not on earth, for ſaith he, <hi>it hath been known, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there hath been ſuch acts of uncleanneſſes in propagation, as the Parent with the child, and the child with the Parent, and ſeverall acts of uncleanneſs hath been committed; now me thinks</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is obſurd, to think that the pure God which hates uncleanneſs; in the leaſt to ſeem to own ſuch a thing as to create or give a ſoul, or to put his hand to the work (as we may ſay) in ſuch an unclean action; but every creature having ſeed in it ſelf, doth bring forth of it ſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its kind, and the man which doth abuſe Gods ordinance, and way in propagation, muſt at laſt ſuffer for it, &amp;c.</hi> This and ſuch like Diſcourſe, did put me upon the ſearch and tryal of things (ſince my laſt book was written) whereby if time would give me admition at this time, I could give you an account of it more at large, but time fails me, and calls for brevity, and therefore ſhall ſay no more to this Subject of diſcourſe, but this, (that is,) The Souls Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality hath been the conceit of the Heathen Philoſophers, which did ſuppoſe, that mortal vertue ſhould be rewarded hereafter, for that all men injoyed bleſſing alike here in this life, and not knowing that there was to be a Reſurrection of the body, whereby perſons might receive the reward of what they have done in the body, they have Imagined ſuch a thing as the ſoul to live and receive a reward; hereafter; and (indeed) the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have readily received ſuch an Opinion; (alſo) from whence the Church of <hi>England</hi> have received it by tradition; and I am ready to believe, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have alſo abuſed our <hi>Greek</hi> Copies in many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, to bear a face toward their opinion; as that text in <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.28. and the ſtop, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.43. and many ſuch places as in reference to this Subject and others alſo; but however the wiſdome of God is ſuch, as that they cannot bury the truth, becauſe he hath given to his people that ſpirit, that gave forth the Scriptures, to reconcile and keep the whole body of the Scriptures in a ſweet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; but as for us that believe, that there is to be a Reſurrection both of the juſt and unjuſt; let us not imagine any ſuch thing as a Souls Immortality (till the Reſurrection;) but know that our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhall be given to us at that day. Me-thinks, the Church of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:119763:32"/>
                        <hi>England</hi> ſeem to deny, ſuch a place as Purgatory, and yet hold an Oppinion that is the riſe of it, and maintains it; for ſay the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, when perſons die they do not go to Hell or Heaven, but the ſoul goeth to a place between both, <hi>viz.</hi> Purgatory, and not to the full joy or puniſhment; and ſo ſay the Church of <hi>England</hi> (in effect) that the ſoul is not in the full joy or torments till after the day of Judgment, as though they could go to Heaven, into Gods preſence, and yet not have there full joy; as though in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence there were not fulneſs of joy, and at his right hand pleaſures for evermore; and alſo, as though when ſouls have been caſt into Hell, and have been puniſhed there, they ſhall be brought from thence again to the Judgment ſeat of Chriſt, to be tryed whether they have deſerved Hell ye or nay: O ſtrange conceit of the pure Juſtice and righteous dealing of God in his puniſhing ſinners, what ſhall ſouls when they have been long in Hell, come out again and enter into a body, it's ſome comfort to them that they ſhall be a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while out of torments, but if they come from Hell they have paid the utmoſt farthing, for when they are once there, <hi>they ſhall in no wiſe come forth, untill they have paid the utmoſt farthing.</hi> Theſe and many ſuch things I might ſpend time about, but this I ſhall leave with thee; (courteous reader) know, that when God takes away mans breath he dyeth, and ſo duſt returns to duſt, and the Spirit (<hi>viz.</hi> breath) to him that gave it; and that breath that returns to God, as it made the man that was made of earth, to become a living ſoul, capable to enjoy what God gave him; even ſo in the Reſurrection, when that duſt is raiſed by God (and every bone and member in its proper place) then ſhall God give forth the ſame breath of life again into every man; and ſo they ſhall be thereby capable to receive according to what they have done in the body, whether it be good, or whether it be evil; and to this the Spirit of God bears witneſs in the holy Scriptures. And ſo I leave this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and come to the next, which is Gods love to the whole lump of man-kind, in uſing a means to bring them to a Reſurrection of life and Glory; and I ſhall handle them in two particular Subjects.</p>
                     <p>The firſt, will be the Reſurrection; and the ſecond, Gods love to man in point of Salvation and glory; and ſo to the firſt Subject; namely, That although man muſt dye and be like water ſpilt upon the ground, yet the Lord will bring him up again from the dead to live for ever in glory, or miſery, according as they have received his grace, and walked worthy of it; or as they have ſlighted and abuſed grace and mercy, and not walked worthy of it.</p>

                     <p>AS touching this Subject of the Reſurrection, I ſhall be brief, yet full enough to prove it to be the truth of God, and the foundation of the godly mans faith and hope; and my method to prove it, ſhall be by laying down this Poſition; which is,</p>
                     <p>That the dead bodies of thoſe that return to the duſt, ſhall live again, and ariſe and come to Judgment, to receive ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what they have done, whether it be good or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</p>
                     <p>For ſo ſaith our bleſſed Saviour, (<hi>John</hi> 5.28. in theſe words) <hi>Marvel not at this, for the hour</hi> (or time as the word will bear it <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

And that this is true, weigh the following Reaſons, which will confirm the truth of the Poſition; and the firſt Reaſon is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe Chriſt himſelf did both die and riſe again to be the firſt fruits of them that ſleep, that he might bear a ſure Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:119763:33"/>
to prove the Reſurrection of the dead; as ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.20, 21. in theſe words, <hi>But now is Chriſt riſen from the dead, and become the firſt fruits of them that ſleep, for ſince by man came death, by man came alſo the Reſurrection of the dead; for as in</hi> (or by) <hi>Adam all die, even ſo in</hi> (or by) <hi>Chriſt ſhall all</hi> (men) <hi>be made alive, but every one in his own order,</hi> verſ. 22.23.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Secondly, becauſe the Scripture ſaith, that our bodies ſhall be redeemed from the Grave, and cloathed with immortality; and indeed it was the very thing that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> waited for and comforted himſelf in, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.19, 20, 21, 22, 33. in theſe words, <hi>For the earneſt expectation of the creature, waiteth for the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sons of God; for the creature was made ſubject to vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not willingly but by reaſon of him who hath ſubjected the ſame, in hope becauſe the creature it ſelf alſo ſhall be delivered from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God; for we know that the whole Creation groaneth, and travelleth in pain together until now, and not only they, but ourſelves alſo, which have the firſt fruits of the Spirit, even we our ſelves groan within our ſelves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;</hi> From whence we may ſee, that the Apoſtle did look and wait in his mind for the Reſurrection of the <hi>BODY,</hi> which is to be underſtood the Reſurrection: and thus we ſee that our <hi>BODIES</hi> ſhall be redeemed from the duſt; (and all kind of Corruption) which proveth the Reſurrection: And ſo I paſs to the third reaſon; which is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Thirdly, becauſe the Scripture ſaith, the dead bodies of ſuch as are in the duſt, ſhall ariſe again, and live, as ſaith the Prophet, (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.19.) in theſe words; <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live, together with my dead bodie ſhall they ariſe; awake and ſing ye that dwell in the duſt, for thy dew is as the dew of Hearbs, and the earth ſhall caſt out the dead,</hi> that is in it. The which agreeth with the words of the Prophet <hi>Ezek.</hi> which ſaith; <hi>And as I propheſied, there was a noiſe, and behold a ſhaking, and the bones came together, bone to his bone; and when I beheld, loe the ſinews and the fleſh came upon them, and the skin covered them about; and there was no breath in them:</hi> Then <hi>I Propheſied as he commanded me, and the breath came upon them, and they lived and ſtood up upon their feet, an exceeding great Army.</hi> From whence we may ſee, that there is to be a Reſurrection of the body out of the duſt of the earth, to life again, that all may come to Judgment to give an account of what they have done in the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:119763:33"/>
                        <hi>body,</hi> whether it be good or evil. And ſo I come to the fourth Reaſon, to prove the Reſurrection of the body; which is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. Fourthly, becauſe the ſame <hi>IT</hi> which is ſown in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, the ſame <hi>IT</hi> riſeth in incorruption, and every ſeed ſhall have its own body; as ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.42. <hi>So alſo is the Reſurrection, IT is ſown in corruption, IT IS raiſed in incorruption; for this corruptible muſt put on incorruption, and this mortal muſt put on immortality; ſo when this corruptible hath put on incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and this mortal ſhall have put on immortality, then ſhall be brought to paſs the ſaying that is written, death is ſwallowed up in victory: O Death where is thy ſting, O Grave where is thy victory;</hi> Which clearly proveth, that the ſame that goeth to the duſt, the ſame riſeth again out of the duſt; only the corruption putting on incorruption, and the mortal putting on immortality, which cannot be underſtood another body, but the ſame body, neither can it be true which is ſaid, Death is ſwallowed up in victory; (no) for if the dead bodies riſe not out of the Graves, then the Grave hath victory, and is not conquered, ſo as to be ſaid, O Grave where is thy victory; but the victory of the Grave is deſtroyed by Chriſts death and Reſurrection, that we ſhould not be holden therein. All which proveth there is to be a Reſurrection of the dead bodies out of the Graves. And ſo I come to the fifth Reaſon, to prove the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead; which is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. Fifthly, Becauſe <hi>Job</hi> alſo confirms this truth, ſaying; <hi>O that my words were now written, O that they were now printed in a book, that they were graven with an Iron Pen, and laid in the rock for ever; for I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he ſhall ſtand at the latter day upon the earth; and though after my skin worms de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour this body, yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſee God, whom I ſhall ſee for my ſelf, and my eyes ſhall behold and not another, although my reins be conſumed, Job</hi> 19.23, 24, 25, 26, 27. From hence we may ſee, that although <hi>Job</hi> were in great afflictions, yet the conſideration of the Reſurrection comforted him; and that he means the very ſame body is plain, becauſe he ſaith, that although worms did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour his body, yet in his fleſh, with his eyes, (and not others) ſhould he ſee Chriſt his Redeemer in the latter day, ſtand upon the earth, whom he ſhould behold for himſelf, and not another. So then the very ſame <hi>Job</hi> that then was in miſery, the very ſame <hi>Job</hi> was afterwards to ſee the Lord: to which add, that the very ſame
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:119763:34"/>
body, that ſuffereth with Chriſt, the very ſame body ſhall raign with Chriſt; for it is againſt pure juſtice, that one body ſhould ſuffer with Chriſt, or for Chriſts ſake, and then another body glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and that body which ſuffered to periſh for ever; this cannot be in juſtice, which alſo proves, that the ſame body ſhall ariſe out of the duſt. And ſo I paſs to the ſixth Reaſon further to prove, that the dead bodies of men which now are aſleep in the duſt of the earth, ſhall awake, live and be raiſed again from the dead; which is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 6. Sixtly, Becauſe <hi>Daniel</hi> further confirms the truth of this ſaying; <hi>Many of them that ſleep in the duſt of the earth ſhall awake, ſome to everlaſting life, and ſome to ſhame and everlaſting contempt, Dan.</hi> 12.2. In this text there is theſe two things conſiderable; the firſt is, that ſuch as ſleep ſhall awake; and Secondly, the place where that they ſleep, and that is in the duſt; and Thirdly, that it is not meant ſpiritually, that is to ſay, to awake out of a ſtate of a ſleep of ſin to Righteouſneſs, becauſe ſome of thoſe that awake, do awake to everlaſting ſhame and contempt; which cannot be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in a ſpiritual fence; for I hope no man is ſo void of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as to think, that ſuch as awake out of ſin, and ſtand up from a ſpiritual death, that they awake to everlaſting ſhame and contempt; but ſome of thoſe that do awake <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith, do awake to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ſhame and contempt; which ſheweth, that thoſe that die and ſleep in the duſt, that the very ſame ſhall ariſe again, even that which ſleeps both of good and bad, ſome to everlaſting Joy, and ſome to ſhame and everlaſting contempt: which clearly proveth, that the dead bodies of ſuch as ſleep in the earth, ſhall (even they themſelves and not another) ariſe. And thus I paſs to the ſeventh reaſon, to prove the Reſurrection; which is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 7. Seventhly, Becauſe Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt:</hi> Now this cannot be meant ſpiritually; firſt, becauſe thoſe that be in Chriſt cannot be ſpiritually dead, that is to ſay, dead in treſpaſſes and ſins; and ſecondly, if it ſhould be Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that there may be dead branches in the Vine, <hi>John.</hi> 15. then I anſwer, that ſuch ſhall forthwith be cut out, and have no priviledge by Chriſt; but the dead in Chriſt ſpoken of both by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and Saint <hi>John,</hi> have priviledge by being dead in Chriſt, which means the death of the body, and the Reſurrection of the body from the dead; that is to ſay, the godly, even ſuch as live and die in Chriſt, ſhall ariſe a thouſand years before the wicked; as you
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:119763:34"/>
may ſee, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.14, 15, 16. compared with <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12. And that this is no ſpiritual Reſurrection, but a Reſurrection of the body, is plain; becauſe it is that which the Apoſtle is a ſpeaking of in that place, as you may read, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.13, 14, 15, 16. In theſe words; <hi>I would not have you ignorant brethren, concerning them that are a ſleep, that ye ſorrow not even at others that have no hope; For if we believe that Jeſus dyed and roſe again, EVEN SO,</hi> (mark that) <hi>them alſo that ſleep in Jeſus, will God bring with him: For this we ſay unto you by the word of the Lord, that we that are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord, ſhall not prevent them which are aſleep; For the Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend from Heaven, with a ſhout, with the voyce of the Archangel, and with the Trump of God; and the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt: Then we which are alive and remain, ſhall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the Air; and ſo ſhall be ever with the Lord.</hi> From whence we may ſee clearly, that the Apoſtle is ſpeaking of the Reſurrection of the body; for ſaith he, <hi>If we beleeve that Jeſus dyed and roſe again; EVEN SO, them ALSO that ſleep,</hi> (the even ſo) implyeth, that as Jeſus ſlept and roſe again; even ſo ſhall we ſleep and riſe again; and we may know, that the ſame body that was crucified unto death, and was buryed, even the ſame body, roſe again; for ſo ſaith Chriſt (to <hi>Thomas</hi>) after his Reſurrection, <hi>Come feel the Print of the nails in my hands, and reach hither thy hand and feel my ſide,</hi> that is pierſed; ſo that we may ſee it was the ſame body, which was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, dead and buryed, which alſo roſe again; even ſo ſhall our bodies, (even the ſelf-ſame body) ariſe out of the duſt of the earth and come to Judgment. And ſo I paſs to the eight Reaſon, to prove that thoſe that are now aſleep in the duſt of the earth, ſhall ariſe from the dead; which is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 8. Eightly, Becauſe Chriſt hath proved it from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the Spirit of God in his People have cauſed them earneſtly to hope and wait for it; and firſt that Chriſt hath proved it, read <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.31, 32. in theſe words <hi>As touching the Reſurrection,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>of the dead, have you not read that which was ſpoken unto you by God, ſaying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob; God is not the God of the dead, but of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> In theſe words Chriſt is proving the Reſurrection, in oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the opinion of the <hi>Saduces,</hi> which held, that there was no Reſurrection; but Chriſt tels them, that they did err no knowing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:119763:35"/>
the Scriptures, nor the power of God; as much as if he ſhould have ſaid, if you had known the Scriptures, you would have believed and acknowledged the Reſurrection; for they bare their Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to the truth thereof; or if you had been well inſtructed about the power and omnipotency of God, it would not have ſeemed to be a thing ſo incredilous unto you, that God ſhould raiſe the dead; for ſaith he, God did tell <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he was the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and God is not the God of the dead but of the living: but now <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> is dead, as if Chriſt ſhould ſay, therefore God is not their God upon your account; O ye <hi>Saduces:</hi> but God is the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> for they live to him; that is in his account, for God ſeeth all things, paſt, preſent, and to come, and calls things that ſhall be, as if they were, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. And ſo he ſeeth all men riſen from the dead, and ſtand before him alive in a Reſurrection; and thus all live to him (<hi>viz.</hi> in his account, and this is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in this text, as I before have ſaid; ſo then there was a ſort of men then, even as there is now, which did deny the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (of the bodies of the dead, which are in the duſt) but Chriſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth them, and proveth; That there is to be a Reſurrection.</p>
                     <p>And Secondly, the Spirit of God in his people have cauſed them earneſtly to hope and wait for it, as you may read, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.35, 36. in theſe words, <hi>Others had tryals of cruel mocking, and ſcourgings; yea moreover of bands and impriſonments; and others were tortured, not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better Reſurrection.</hi> From theſe things which have been written, you may ſee, that both Chriſt have proved, and the Saints earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hoped and waited for the Reſurrection, and indeed (and in truth) it was never queſtioned by the godly, for when Chriſt tels <hi>Martha,</hi> that her brother <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſhould riſe again; <hi>I know (ſaith ſhe) that my brother ſhall ariſe again, in the Reſurrection, at the laſt day:</hi> ſhe never once queſtioned, but that her brother, (even the ſame man <hi>Lazarus</hi>) ſhould ariſe again at the laſt day; which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that both Chriſt and the Saints doth prove and acknowledg, that thoſe that ſleep in the duſt of the earth, ſhall ariſe, even the ſame bodies, (only incorruptible) and come to Judgment. And ſo I paſs to the ninth Reaſon, to prove that thoſe which are aſleep in the duſt of the earth, ſhall ariſe; which is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 9. Ninthly, Becauſe otherwiſe were the Saints in a worſe condition then the wicked, for they bear about in their bodies the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:119763:35"/>
dying of the Lord Jeſus, and ſuffer deeply, and are accounted as ſheep for the ſlaughter; and the wicked they eat and drink, and take their pleaſure: now if there be no Reſurrection, then the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed were in the beſt condition; for if there were no Reſurrection then there would be no judgment, and then the word, <hi>remember for all this, God will bring thee to judgment,</hi> were of no force; and I never yet read of a day of judgment (ſince <hi>Adams</hi> being caſt out of Paradiſe) to be till after the Reſurrection, and then no Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, no Judgment; then I may ſay with Saint <hi>Paul; Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we ſhall die;</hi> but that there is to be a Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that it will go ill with the wicked, read, <hi>John</hi> 5.28. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. (and the like) But if there were no Reſurrection, then the righteous were in the worſt condition, as you may read, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.16, 17, 18, 19. in theſe words. <hi>For if the dead riſe not, then is not Chriſt raiſed; and if Chriſt be not raiſed, your faith is vain, and ye are yet in your ſins: Then they alſo which are fallen aſleep in Chriſt, are periſhed; if in this life only we have hope in Chriſt, we are of all men moſt miſerable.</hi> From whence we ſee, were it not for a Reſurrection the wicked were in the beſt condition, and the Saints of all men the moſt miſerable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their ſufferings; but it is not ſo, for they are in the moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt condition. And thus I paſs to the tenth Reaſon, to prove that the dead (as before ſaid) ſhall ariſe; which is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 10. Becauſe the Scripture ſaith, that our vile bodies ſhall be faſhioned and made like unto Chriſts glorious body; as ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20, 21. in theſe words, <hi>For our converſation is in heaven, from whence alſo we look for the Saviour the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; who will change our vile bodies, (OR RENEW, OR RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORM, OR P<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T IT INTO A BETTER ESTATE; AS THE WORD</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or, <hi>Qui reformabit corpus, WILL BEAR IT) that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious body.</hi> From whence we may ſee, that the dead ſhall ariſe and have their vile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies renewed, or reformed, even changed into another eſtate and condition, yet the ſame body, and made in faſhion like to Chriſts glorious body: ſo then, it is not another body, but theſe our vile bodies faſhioned, and made like to Chriſts glorious body; which proveth, that the ſame body which dyeth, the ſame body ſhall riſe again, only corruption and imperfection taken away; and this agreeth with the whole current of Scripture. And thus I paſs to the Eleventh Reaſon, to prove, that ſuch as are returned to duſt, ſhall again awake and come forth out of their graves unto judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="58" facs="tcp:119763:36"/>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 11. Eleventhly, Becauſe the Scriptures ſaith, That all things even the whole Creation, ſhall be delivered from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of corruption, and reſtored into its primitive eſtate; only thoſe excepted, who have voluntarily made themſelves miſerable for ever; yet even they ſhall ariſe with ſuch a body as ſhall not die any more; (the greater will be their miſery) And that there is to be ſuch a Reſurrection, read theſe Scriptures, <hi>Acts.</hi> 3.19, 20.21. <hi>Rem.</hi> 8.20, 21. in theſe wordes, <hi>Repent ye therefore and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, that your ſins may be blotted out: when the times of refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord; And he will ſend Jeſus which before was preached unto you, whom the heavens muſt receive until the times of reſtitution of all things; which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy Prophets, ſince the world began; for the creature was made ſubject to vanity, not willingly, but by reaſon of him (viz. Adam) who hath ſubjected the ſame in hope; for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travelleth in pain together until now; becauſe the creature it ſelf alſo ſhall be delivered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God: for even we our ſelves groan within our ſelves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the Redemption of our bodies.</hi> From theſe Scriptures, and more that might be added (of this nature) it doth appear, that the bodies of the ſons of men, ſhall be raiſed again from the dead, and he reſtored into that eſtate wherein they were created; and alſo into the glorious eſtate that the body of Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is in; for when he ſhall appear, we ſhall be made like him, and he hath a body of fleſh and bones, which proves the Reſurrection; for if it be not the ſame body that goeth to the duſt which is raiſed again, but another body, then it is a new Creation, and not a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by a Reſurrection; and then is not the Scriptures true, which ſaith, <hi>O Death I will be thy Death;</hi> and, <hi>Death ſhall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver up her dead;</hi> but God and the Scriptures is true, and all them that do deny that the dead bodies ſhall again live, and ariſe out of the duſt of the earth, are lyers. And ſo I paſs to the Twelfth and laſt reaſon, (although I might add many more if time would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit) to prove, That the dead which ſleep in the duſt, (both good and bad) ſhall ariſe and come to Judgment; which is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 12. Becauſe the Scripture ſaith, that although <hi>we muſt needs die, and be as water ſpilt upon the ground, yet</hi> God <hi>hath uſed a means that</hi> thoſe that are thus <hi>baniſhed, ſhould not be for ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled from him:</hi> for Chriſt hath <hi>deſtroyed him, that had power over
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:119763:36"/>
death, which is the Devil; and hath delivered us,</hi> (by Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) <hi>who by the reaſon of the fear of death were kept in ſlavery all our life long.</hi> For nothing would be ſo troubleſome to the godly, as the thought of death, were it not for a Reſurrection; but ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will ranſome them from the power of the grave, I will redeem them from death; O Death I will be thy Plague; O Grave I will be thy deſtruction: He will ſwallow up death in victory, and the Lord will wipe away tears from all faces, Hoſea</hi> 13.14. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.8. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14.</p>
                     <p>From theſe Reaſons and Scriptures, (and many more which might be added,) we may clearly ſee, That the dead, (namely ſuch, as do (now and ſhall) ſleep in the duſt) ſhall ariſe (both good and bad) and come to Judgment. And now courteous Reader, ſeeing it is ſo, that the dead (as before ſaid) muſt ariſe and come to Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, be exhorted to take up that good reſolution, with (the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man) <hi>Job</hi> 14.14. which ſaith, <hi>If a man die ſhall he live again, then all the dayes of my appointed time will I wait till my change come,</hi> giving thanks alwayes to the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>which according to his abundant mercy, hath begotten us again unto a lively hope, by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead; to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, that fadeth not away.</hi> Therefore, <hi>gird up the lines of thy mind, waiting for that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed hope, and glorious appearing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; who will change our vile bodies, and faſhion them like unto his glorious bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, according to his (promiſe and) mighty working; whereby he is able to ſubdue all things unto himſelf; who hath aboliſhed death, and brought life and immortality to light.</hi> To whom be praiſe and glory, for ever and ever, Amen, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20, 21. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, take this word of advice by way of Caution; (which is) take heed and beware of giving heed to ſuch as do deny the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection; of whom there is two ſorts now in our dayes, as there was in the Apoſtles dayes; the one ſort is like unto the <hi>Saduces, Mat.</hi> 22.23. which deny, that there is any Reſurrection, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels or Spirits, (<hi>viz.</hi> God or Devil) Heaven or Hell, of that ſort is the <hi>Ranter</hi> and his adherents; and ſuch like <hi>Athieſtical</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. And the other, are like unto <hi>HYMENE<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> and <hi>PHILE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>T<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.17, 18. <hi>who ſay, that the Reſurrection is already paſt; whoſe words eat as doth a canker;</hi> and of this ſort is the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who doth affirm, that he is already riſen from the dead,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:119763:37"/>
and in the Reſurrection, and ſo the Reſurrection is paſt to him; who denyeth iniquity in (words in) the hiſtory, and yet heaps up iniquity upon iniquity in the myſtery. And theſe are the two ſorts which may fitly be compared unto the Sect of the <hi>Saduces,</hi> and to <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Phyletus;</hi> and I do not report the things whereof I write by hear-ſay, but from their own mouths, (the more is the pitty and to be lamented.) Theſe two ſorts differ in manners or converſation, but very little in Judgment, (in point of doctrine) unleſs it be in that of converſation (as before ſaid) the which if they had the converſation of Angels, and yet ſo corrupt in princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Scripture declares them to be in a curſed and miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18, 19. <hi>Acts.</hi> 3.23, 24. And indeed the converſation of many of them, is bad enough, although they disfigure their faces, and ſeem unto men (to faſt from ſin and) to be more righteous then others; yet they have been ſeen to want that ſpecial duty of prayer in their families, and giving thanks in the preſence of their Families for their food; (which God hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on them) although Chriſt and the Apoſtle, did not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to do their duty in that caſe, to lead us an example; but no more as to this, I ſhall leave it until the day in the which God will try the wayes of the ſons of men, and diſcover all deceit and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, of what nature ſoever it be.</p>
                     <p>But as touching the opinion about Gods holy Ordinances, by which he hath appointed to be worſhipped in; is ſleighted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by them, as water-Baptiſme, and eating of Bread, and drinking of Wine, (ſolemnly celebrated) to ſet forth Chriſts death and a participation of the benefit thereof; with the ſlightings of forms, as they call them, although God delight in nothing which is out of form and order: as the hoſt of Heaven and earth doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, who when God found them without form, (and void) did by his word put them in form and order, and gave decrees to the Sea, and ordinances unto the Sun, Moon, and Stars, and they keep them: ſo that God delights in form and order, and alſo is a God of order in all the Churches of the Saints; hence Saint <hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended form, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.17, 18. in theſe words, <hi>But ye have obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the heart, that form of Doctrine which was delivered unto you, being therefore made free from ſin, ye became the ſervants of Righteouſneſs, &amp;c.</hi> From whence you may ſee, That thoſe men which do ſlight and deny forms in our dayes, have not received that Spirit which was in the Apoſtle, but another Spirit, even the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:119763:37"/>
Spirit of error; although it ſtrive to transform it ſelf into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of light, that thereby it may deceive the hearts of the ſimple; for men are got to this height of wickedneſs in the myſtery, as to think that they comprehend all things, and ſo conſequently are Gods; but they ſhall die like men, for their breath is in their noſtrils: yet talk of what you will, (almoſt) it is in them, (as they ſay) as the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and the ſecond, and God; and alſo the Serpent ſlain within them, the tree of life, and the tree of knowledg, the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat, Heaven and Hell, Mount Zion, and the new Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem; the two witneſſes; and what not! they have comprehended all theſe things, as they ſay; but alaſs, they die, and in the very ſame time their thoughts periſh, and they are chaſed and gone, like a viſion of the night: Mark one peece of horrible pride of Spirit which is in them, they will not allow the holy Scriptures to be called the word of the Lord, neither do they exhort and preſs men to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to read and keep the things contained therein; but their fraughty books, muſt (ſome of them) bear the Title of the word of the Lord, to the world and earthly men, and the like, ſo that he that ſeeth but very little, may ſee them to be the men before ſpoken of, which ſhall deny all that is worſhipped, as God, ſhewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they are God; O horrible pride, and yet pretended humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, this is ungodlineſs in a myſtery; I ſhall not enter upon the particulars of their bottomleſs opinion; firſt, becauſe it is not my task at this time; and ſecondly, becauſe time alſo (at preſent) will not give leave in reference to other occaſions; I only hinted at theſe few things, to caution the courteous Reader, to take heed and try well, what doctrine he doth receive before he receiveth it.</p>

                     <p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that and ſuch like Objections I briefly anſwer and ſay, That this no whit contradicts, that men (after they be riſen) ſhall be fleſh, blood, and bones; if we conſider that the ſame Apoſtle o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens the meaning of his words in the very next verſe, by ſaying, neither doth corruption inherit incorruption; ſhewing, that his meaning is, that that corruption of fleſh and blood, or fleſh and blood corrupted, ſhall not enter into the Kingdome of Heaven,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:119763:38"/>
until that corruption hath put on incorruption: ſo then, while it is corrupted fleſh and blood, it cannot enter into the kingdome of Heaven, for no corrupt thing ſhall come there; yet notwithſtanding man, which is fleſh and bone, is at this time in Heaven, and ſo ſhall many more after the Reſurrection inherit that glory, and yet ſhall be fleſh and bones, for man was created ſo at the firſt, before he was corrupted, and ſhall be ſo (namely fleſh and bone) after his corruption is taken away; for when he ceaſeth to be fleſh and bone, then he will ceaſe alſo to be man, unleſs man can conſiſt and have a being without fleſh and bone, which cannot be: Moreover the text it ſelf may be read (and doth well bear it) thus, <hi>For this I ſay unto you bretheren, that the corrupt nature or infirmity (OF MAN) cannot enter into the kingdome of God.</hi> For ſo the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal will bear it from the word (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,) and being ſo read, it lyeth without Objection, for I have ever affirmed, that the corruption or infirmity of man, ſhall not enter into the kingdome of God, but ſhall be taken away before that time.</p>
                     <p>And where it is ſaid, <hi>That that which thou ſoweſt, thou ſoweſt not the ſame body that ſhall be, but God giveth it a body as pleaſeth him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To which I anſwer and ſay, that it is true, it is not the ſame body which is ſown in reſpect of corruption, for the text ſaith, that <hi>it is ſown in corruption, and it is raiſed in incorruption;</hi> and ſo it is true in that ſence, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, that is, it is not the body of corruption which is raiſed, although every ſeed ſhall have its own body, only the corruption taken away; and this is the meaning of the Apoſtle in this place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Object.</hi> And as touching that objection ſpoken by <hi>Job</hi> 7.9. in theſe words, <hi>As the cloud is conſumed and vaniſheth away, ſo he that goeth down to the grave ſhall come up no more.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I anſwer and ſay, That theſe texts of Scripture, are the moſt material ones that I know of, whereby the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be denyed, although ſome other ſeem to ſhew a colour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; and that we may ſee that this Scripture intends no ſuch thing as (ſome would have it to do even) to deny that the ſame body ſhall ariſe, and enter into the kingdome of God; read the next verſe, and that will ſhew you that <hi>Job</hi> means, that men which die ſhall riſe no more ſo as to be known as men after the fleſh; as men that have taken a great journey, and be long abſent, do return and poſſeſs their houſes and habitations, but man ſhall not ſo ariſe as
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:119763:38"/>
to poſſeſs his former houſe or habitation; and this appears to be <hi>Jobs</hi> meaning, as from <hi>verſe</hi> the 10. in theſe words, <hi>He ſhall return no more to his houſe, neither ſhall his place know him any more.</hi> So then, this 10 <hi>verſe</hi> expounds <hi>Jobs</hi> meaning in the 9 <hi>verſe,</hi> or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Job</hi> ſadly contradicts himſelf; ſo that we cannot tell when he ſpeaks the truth, for he doth frequently declare the Reſurrection of the body, as in <hi>Chapter</hi> 14.12. and 14. <hi>Chapter</hi> 19.26, 27.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things conſidered, I ſhall only add a Uſe of Comfort to thoſe that do believe, that all that are aſleep in the duſt ſhall come to a Reſurrection; to receive what they have done in the body, whether good or evil; and being perſwaded thereof, do wait all their dayes in the right way of the Lord, until their change come, even to ſuch the Scripture ſpeaks much comfort, for they ſhall be exalted to inherit the earth, in the morning of their Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they ſhall have dominion over the wicked, and they ſhall be as aſhes under the ſoles of their feet, when thoſe that have walked wiſely ſhall ſhine as the Firmament, and they that have turned ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to righteouſneſs as ſtars for ever and ever; therefore know, that although the wrath of man may (poſſibly) lay thee in the duſt, yet from thence the Lord will bring thee, and ſet thee with Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and put a Crown of Righteouſneſs upon thine head, and make thee inherit the throne of glory, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.34. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.14, 15, 16. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3, 4. <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2, 3. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3, 4, 5. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.6, 7, 8. <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.12, 13. <hi>Chap.</hi> 20.5, 6, 7, 8.</p>
                     <p>And thus I paſs from this ſubject of Diſcourſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and come to the next, which is, The love of God to all men, in giving of his Son to bring them to a Reſurrection, and after that to an eternal weight of glory, if they ſell it not for the pleaſure and glory of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world, as <hi>Eſau</hi> ſould his birth-right, for a meſs of pottage, and ſo he received not the bleſſing.</p>

                     <head>Gods Love to Man-kind DISCOVERED.</head>
                     <p>AS touching Gods univerſal Love to the Sons of Men, (or the whole lump of Man-kind) I need not ſpend much time about, for the Scriptures are full, and the truth thereof is written, (as I may ſay) in Capital Letters, ſo that he that runs may read and ſee the truth thereof; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall be brief as to this Subject of Diſcourſe: and in order to the clearing of it, I ſhall lay down this Poſition, as the ground-work to the Diſcourſe; which is,</p>
                     <p>That Gods Love was ſo great to the Lump of Man kind, (<hi>viz.</hi> the whole World) that he gave his only begotten Son to Death, to bring all men to a Reſurrection, and to an Eternal weight of Glory; (the which glory all men ſhall enjoy) if they ſell it not by their ſins. <hi>Or thus, (in ſhort)</hi> Jeſus Chriſt taſted death for every Man and Woman.</p>
                     <p>And that this is truth, read theſe few Scriptures, (as firſt) <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. in theſe words, <hi>We ſee Jeſus who was made a little lower then Angels for the ſuffering of death was crowned with glory and honour, that he by the grace of God ſhould taſte death for every man.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>From whence we may learn, that Jeſus Chriſt did die for all men, or the whole lump or quantity of man, as it is rendred from the Greek Phraſes, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, and to this agreeth the ſaying of our bleſſed Saviour, written by Saint <hi>John</hi> 3.16, 17. in theſe words, <hi>God ſo loved the WORLD</hi> (mark the word <hi>WORLD</hi>) <hi>that he gave his only
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:119763:39"/>
begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life; for God ſent not his Son into the WORLD to condemn the WORLD, but that the WORLD thorrow him might be ſaved.</hi> To which add that which is written, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. in theſe words, <hi>My little children, theſe things I write unto you, that ye ſin not; but if any man ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propitiation of our ſins; and not for ours only, but alſo for the ſins of the WHOLE WORLD.</hi> From theſe Scriptures, with many more that might be added, it doth evidently appear, that Jeſus Chriſt did die for every man; and yet further to confirm this truth, I ſhall prove it by ſircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locution, or plain reaſons drawn from the Scripture; and the firſt is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Firſt, Becauſe God hath ſworn by himſelf, (becauſe he could ſwear by no greater) that he deſireth not the death of ſuch as die, or of the wicked; but tels them that their deſtruction is of themſelves, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. in theſe words, <hi>Say unto them, as I live ſaith the LORD GOD, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that he would turn from his wicked wayes and live; turn ye, turn ye, from your evil wayes, for why will ye die O houſe of Iſrael;</hi> And <hi>wo be to thee Jeruſalem, wilt thou not be made clean, when ſhall it once be?</hi> Thy deſtruction is of thy ſelf, thy wickedneſs hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured it, <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.22, 27. From whence we may ſee, that God is ſo far from decreeing any mans damnation ſimply of his own will, unleſs in reference to their rejecting of grace tendered, that he hath entred into an oath before the ſons of men, not to deſire their ruin, unleſs they reſiſt his ſpirit in the tenders of grace; which ſheweth that he gave his Son to die for ſuch as periſh; for without blood there is no remiſſion of ſins: ſo then there cannot be a tender of the Goſpel (which is remiſſion of ſins) to ſuch for whom Chriſt dyed not; but more of that anon, I paſs at preſent to the ſecond Reaſon, to prove that God gave Chriſt to die for all men to bring them to a Reſurrection and glory, as before ſaid; which is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Secondly, Becauſe as God hath ſworn not to take pleaſure in the death of them that die, ſo he hath alſo ſaid, that it is good and acceptable in his ſight, and well pleaſing to him, to have all men have Salvation; and to that end Chriſt dyed as you may read, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. in theſe words, <hi>I exhort therefore firſt of all, Supplications, Prayers, interceſſions, and giving of thanks be made for ALL MEN; for Kings, and for all that are
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:119763:40"/>
in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and honeſty; for this is good and acceptable in the ſight of God our Saviour, who would have ALL MEN to be ſaved, and come to the knowledg of the truth: For there is one God and one Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and men, the man Chriſt Jeſus; who gave himſelf a ranſome for ALL, to be teſtified in due time.</hi> From whence we may ſee, that (firſt) as God hath ſworn by himſelf, that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth not the death of the wicked. Secondly, that he alſo (ſaith he) would have all men ſaved; and that they might be ſaved, he ſaith that he gave Chriſt to be a ranſome for all men; ſo that from theſe two reaſons, you may ſee Gods love to all men extended; and I paſs to the third Reaſon; which is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Thirdly, Becauſe God hath commanded the Goſpel to be declared to all men, and condemneth ſuch as believe it not; and the Goſpel is to be underſtood good news, <hi>(viz.)</hi> remiſſion of ſins and ſalvation by Chriſts blood; and commandeth men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it upon pain of eternal wrath: But if Chriſt did not die, for every man, to whom the Goſpel is commanded to be preached, then a lye is commanded to be preached to the greateſt part of men, and they damned becauſe they believe (and receive) it not; the which to ſay, were ridiculous and blaſphemy: But that you may ſee, that this is true, conſider well, that if there be a Command given to Chriſts Miniſters to preach the Goſpel to every man, (that is to ſay in plain engliſh, that Chriſt dyed for their ſins and roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain for their Juſtification) and yet Chriſt did not die for every man, then this is to command a lye to be preached, to the greateſt part of men, and they damned for not believing of it, if Chriſt only dyed for a few as ſome ſay, the which ſo to ſay is wickedneſs; and then alſo thoſe that are damned for not believing the Goſpel, are damned for not believing a lye; and how wicked ſuch an opinion is, I ſhall leave all to Judge who know any thing of God; And that you may ſee, that the Goſpel is to be preached to every creature, and men to believe it upon penalty of condemnation, read <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. in theſe words, And he ſaid unto <hi>them, go ye into ALL THE WORLD,</hi> (mark that) <hi>and preach the Goſpel to EVERY CREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>T<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RE,</hi> (mark that) <hi>he that believeth and is baptiſed, ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not, ſhall be damned.</hi> From whence we may ſee, that the Goſpel, namely, the good news of Salvation thorow Chriſts blood, is to be preached to every man, and whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doth not believe it, namely, that there is life and remiſſion of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:119763:40"/>
ſins for them, thorow Chriſts blood, are to be damned, becauſe they make God a lyar, <hi>John</hi> 3. Chap. 8. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.10. Theſe well conſidered, ſheweth that God did give his Son, (the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus) to die for every man as before ſaid; and ſo I paſs to the fourth Reaſon; which is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. Fourthly, Becauſe it is very plain, that ſo many as were made ſinners by the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo many were made righteous by the ſecond <hi>Adam;</hi> and it is evident, that all were made ſinners by the firſt <hi>Adam; Ergo,</hi> all are made righteous (alſo) by the ſecond <hi>Adam;</hi> for there is <hi>all</hi> ſet in opoſition to <hi>all;</hi> that is to ſay, ſo many (all) as was made ſinners by <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo many (all) was made righteous by Chriſt; and if ſo then it doth follow undeny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, that God gave Chriſt to die for every man; and that the premiſes are true, read the words of Saint <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 5.18, 19. which ſaith; <hi>Therefore as by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation, even ſo by the righteouſneſs, the free gift came upon all men unto juſtification of life; for as by one mans diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one, many be made righteous.</hi> From theſe words we may ſee All ſet in opoſition to All, and Many in opoſition to Many, which proveth what hath been before ſaid; and thus it is undeniable, that God did give his Son to die for all men.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. Fifthly, it further appears, that God hath given Chriſt to die for all, becauſe that God did invite and exhort ſuch to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which upon the rejecting of grace are appointed to repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, as is evident, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.37. in theſe words, <hi>How long ye ſimple ones, will ye love ſimplicity, and the ſcorner delight in ſcorning, and fools hate know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; turn ye at my reproofe, behold I will pour out my Spirit unto you, I will make known my mind unto you: becauſe I called and ye refuſed, I ſtretched out my hand, and no man regarded; but ye have ſet at naught all my counſel, and would have none of my reproofe: I will alſo laugh at your calamity, and mock when your fear com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; Then ſhall they call upon me, but I will not anſwer, they ſhall ſeek me early, but they ſhall not find me; for that they have hated knowledge, and did not chuſe the fear of the Lord. Jeruſalem Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, thou that killeſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them that are ſent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy children together, as a Hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, but ye would not; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I leave unto you your houſes deſolate;</hi> For <hi>the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:119763:41"/>
is like to a certain King, which made a marriage for his ſon, and ſent ſorth his ſervants to call them that were bidden to the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but they would not come; Again he ſent forth other ſervants ſaying, tell them that are bidden, behold all things are prepared, come unto the marriage; but they made light of it, and went their wayes one to his farm, and another to his Merchandiſe, and the remnant took his ſervants, and intreated them ſpitefully and killed them; And when the King heard thereof, he ſaid, none of thoſe that were bidden ſhall taſte of my ſupper, but was wrath with them, and ſent forth his armies and deſtroyed thoſe murderers, and burnt up their Cities, Mat.</hi> 22.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. compared with <hi>Luke</hi> 14.24. From whence we may ſee, that thoſe that never ſhall partake of that rich benefit which is held forth in this Parable, (<hi>viz.</hi> glory) becauſe they rejected it; yet notwithſtanding it was once offered unto them and alſo intended them, if they had not rejected it; but thankfully received it; for take notice, God never yet offered that to any man, which he intended him not, if he would accept of it and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, for God offereth nothing by way of complement, but all his words and works are done in truth, faithfulneſs, and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and therefore cannot offer more then he hath to give, or more then he doth intend to give, if perſons do receive it when he offereth it; which proveth that Chriſt did die for all men, and hence all men have the tenders of grace, and ſuch only periſh who reject grace; and ſo I paſs to the ſixt Reaſon, to prove that God gave Chriſt to die for all men, that they might attain a Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to life and glory, if they (like <hi>Adam</hi> or <hi>Eſau</hi>) ſell it not by ſin; which is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 6. Sixtly, Becauſe thoſe that are damned are charged with denying the Lord which bought them; (mark that) and ſo heap upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. and if ſo, then it is evident, that Chriſt did die for all men; to which I add this Argument.</p>
                     <p>That if Chriſt dyed for thoſe that are ſaved, and thoſe that are damned, then he dyed for all men; But he dyed for thoſe that are ſaved, and thoſe that are damned; <hi>Ergo,</hi> he did die for all men.</p>
                     <p>That he dyed for thoſe that are ſaved none will deny, and that he did die for thoſe that are deſtroyed or damned, is alſo proved in theſe words, <hi>But there was falſe Prophets amongſt the people, even as there ſhall be falſe teachers amongſt you; who privily ſhall bring
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:119763:41"/>
in DAMNABLE Hereſies, even DENYING THE LORD THAT BO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>GHT THEM, and BRING <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>PON THEM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SEL<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ES SWIFT DESTR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CTION.</hi> From whence we may ſee plainly, that ſome of them that the Lord hath bought or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed, ſhall be found in Damnable wayes, ſo as to deny the Lord that purchaſed them, or bought them, and ſo heap unto themſelves ſwift deſtruction; and that this purchaſe is no other way, then but with Chriſts blood, read 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19 <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. And what <hi>puniſhment ſhall he be thought worthy of, who treads under foot the Son of God, and counts the blood of the Covenant, wherewith he was ſanctified an unholy thing, and doth deſpite to the Spirit of grace:</hi> We ought to conclude that ſuch are guilty of the body and blood of Chriſt by crucifiing him again afreſh, &amp; putting him to open ſhame; ſo then there be ſome whom the Lord hath bought which will come to deny him and ſo periſh; which ſheweth that Chriſt dyed for all men, for ſuch as are ſaved, and ſuch as periſh, and that mans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is of himſelf, and Gods love great to all men. And ſo I paſs to the ſeventh Reaſon, to prove that God gave his Son to die for all men, as before ſaid; which is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 7. Seventhly, Becauſe men that periſh are charged with the neglect of their Salvation, but if Chriſt never dyed for them, then there never was any means or way of Salvation, and then it is an impoſſible thing to neglect it, for it cannot be truly ſaid, that man can neglect the attaining of that by ſlothfulneſs, which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be attained with all his diligence; but if Chriſt did not die for all men, then thoſe whom he dyed not for, could not either neglect, put away, or reject, their own ſalvation; but ſuch as periſh do neglect, reject, and put away their own ſalvation; which ſheweth, that Chriſt did die for all men, and that there is ſufficient means of Salvation to accompliſh the end thereof, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.12, 13. <hi>Act.</hi> 13.46. And thus briefly, I paſs to the eighth Reaſon, and alſo haſten to the concluſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 8. Eightly, Becauſe God is no reſpector of perſons, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.8, 9, 10. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.34. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.17, 18. And therefore it doth appear, that God did give Chriſt to die for all men, or otherwiſe God of neceſſity muſt be a reſpector of perſons, for all men were created happy alike in the lines of <hi>Adam,</hi> or otherwiſe grievous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities would follow; and as all men were created alike happie in <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo all men ſinned alike in him; and now if God had given Chriſt to dye but for a few of them, then was God a reſpector of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:119763:42"/>
perſons, and then was not the free gift and ſatisfaction as large as the transgreſſion, then was not the Serpents head broken; and if ſo, then was Chriſt an imperfect Saviour, which to ſay were blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; but Chriſt is the Saviour of all men, and eſpecially of ſuch as do believe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. that is, he hath ſaved all men from the power of the grave, and brought them under promiſe of life; and then afterwards thoſe that ſin and forfeit their bliſs, yet if they believe in him and humble themſelves before him, he takes off that ſin alſo by his mediator-ſhip, under the law in types, and now in ſubſtance, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.8, 9, 10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. And ſo Chriſt is the Saviour of all men; but without he dyed for all men, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the Saviour of all, for without blood there is no remiſſion of ſins; which ſheweth plainly, that God gave Chriſt to die for all men. And ſo I paſs to the ninth Reaſon, to prove that Chriſt dyed for all men; which is,</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 9. Ninthly, Becauſe Chriſt is called the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the world; he is alſo ſaid to give his life for the world, and to bear the iniquities of all, that all thorrow him might be ſaved: which ſheweth, that God the father gave him to die for all men, and alſo that he did die for all men; and thus I paſs to the tenth and laſt Reaſon, to prove that Chriſt did die for all men; which is,</p>

                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 10. Tenthly, Becauſe God will be clear of the blood of all men, and prove to the Sons of men in the day of Judgment, that their deſtruction will be of themſelves; ſo that every mouth ſhall be ſtopped, and all tongues confeſs that their not conſidering in their day the things that did belong to their peace, is the cauſe of their eternal ruin; and that God did ſtrive with them, but they did reſiſt him, and ſay to God, depart from us for we deſire not the knowledg of thy wayes, for we will walk every one in our own wayes, and after the immagination of our own heart: So then men periſh not for want of the tenders of grace, but becauſe they reject Gods grace and counſel when it is tendered, and will not come to him that they may have life; ſo then God did ſend his Son to die for all men, to bring them to a Reſurrection, and alſo to an eternal weight of glory, if they ſell it not by their perſonal ſins; for he did die for all that were dead, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15. Secondly, he was Salvation to all that did accept of it, to the end of the world, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.1, 2. Thirdly, he was a ranſome for all men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. Fourthly, hath commanded that this good news ſhall be declared
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:119763:42"/>
unto all men, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15. And finally, all preachers do declare the ſame (in their preaching at one time or another) although they deny it in private conference; but let God and his word be true, (and every man a lyer) that he may be juſt when he Judgeth; and thus I ſhall wind up all with this Uſe of Encouragement.</p>
                     <p>Is it ſo, that Chriſt did die for all men, to ſet open a door of Salvation to every man; then let every one that ſhall read and hear this news, be encouraged to come to Chriſt and learn of him, to walk as he hath lead him an example, and follow his ſteps, and they ſhall find reſt to their ſouls, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28. For <hi>the Spirit and the Bride ſaith come, and let him that heareth ſay come, and let him that is a thirſt come, and whoever will, let him take off the water of life freely, Rev.</hi> 22.17.</p>
                     <p>Peradventure ſome poor dejected ſoul may ſee and peruſe theſe lines, and ſay it is true, God is gracious and ſlow to anger and great in kindneſs, but it is to the righteous, and I am a great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                     <p>To thee O ſoul I ſay, in the name and fear of the Lord, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God be of too pure eyes then to behold iniquity, yet if thou now ſeeth thy ſins to be thy burthen, and doth with purpoſe of heart turn to the Lord, there is a door of Salvation ſet open unto thee, and mercy prepared for thee, and let not the Devil take an advantage againſt thee, and make ſhip-wrack of thee againſt any of theſe two Rocks; (as I may ſay error, in the Sea) namely, that of Election and Reprobation, by the which many a ſoul hath been deſtroyed; as firſt by perſwading ſome that although they go or in ſin, yet if they be elected, God will have a time to call them out of it, (not knowing the manner of Gods call) and ſo have took liberty to ſin; and thereby have been lead captive by the Devil at his pleaſure, adding ſin unto ſin, until their iniquity hath been filled up to the full, and become their ruin.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, take heed of this rock, that is to ſay, let not Satan drive thee into deſperation by perſwading of thee, that thou being a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and often ſinned againſt God, that thou art not an elect veſſel, and then although thou humble thy ſelfe never ſo much before God, yet there is no means of Salvation for thee, becauſe Chriſt hath not dyed for thee, and therefore no Salvation; I ſay, take heed of this rock, for it is very dangerous, for Satan hath driven ſome ſo hard upon it, that in deſpairing Gods love and mercy have become their own executioners; but be thou inſtructed and know,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:119763:43"/>
that Chriſt hath dyed for every man, and that there is a door of Salvation ſet open to all men that they may have life; for God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth not their death, but willeth their life and Salvation; therefore <hi>let the wicked forſake his wayes, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and turn unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon;</hi> for if there <hi>ſins have been as ſcarlet, yet he will make them as ſnow, and if as chrimſon, he will make them as wool,</hi> if they be willing and obedient: but if they be obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and rebellious they ſhall be deſtroyed, for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.7. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.15, 16, 17, 18. So then for ſinners that turn to God there is mercy, and Chriſts death is the ground of the hope of mercy; but ſuch as turn aſide to their crooked paths and wicked practiſes, the Lord will lead them forth with the workers of iniquity; but peace ſhall be unto all ſuch as turn to the Lord in uprightneſs of heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.2, 3. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11, 12. <hi>Luke.</hi> 15.6, 7, 8, 9. Time being preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous with me, ſo as that I cannot inlarge my ſelf upon this Subject, and Subjects of this nature, by anſwering objections as otherwiſe I would do, if I had time, as God ſhould aſſiſt me, I ſhall in a brief method, (namely by queſtion and anſwer) anſwer the moſt materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al objections, (that I at preſent mind) as touching this and ſuch like Subjects, and that briefly; and ſo to the firſt.</p>
                     <p>Queſtion 1. <hi>What do you think of the point of Predeſtination, hath not God fore-appointed ſome to Salvation, and others to Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea God of old did appoint righteous men to Salvation, and wicked men, even ſuch as turn the grace of God into wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) for Damnation, <hi>John</hi> 2.3, 4. although God never did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point any man to be wicked; yet he hath of old foreſeen wickedneſs, and alſo hath appointed puniſhment for it.</p>
                     <p>Queſtion 2. <hi>Hath not God Elected one ſort of perſons to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (before the world was) from whence they cannot fall, and rejected another ſort, which cannot be recovered?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nay, for then all did not fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> neither were all juſtified by Chriſt; but all did fall by <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, and all were juſtified by Chriſts righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. Miſtake not, there is a twofold juſtification, I ſhall not explain it at preſent, but read the text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. Secondly, there is no ſuch thing, becauſe that many times thoſe that have been wicked, have become righteous, and of bad have been made good; and alſo ſuch as have been righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:119763:43"/>
and good, have become wicked and bad, as the Angels which were once good, are now bad; alſo <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19, 20. and thoſe ſpoken of, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.12, and 15. who had condemnation, or were condemned becauſe they had forſook their firſt faith: and <hi>Saul</hi> had once the ſpirit of God, and was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, and yet he became wicked by reaſon of his wickedneſs about the buſineſs of the <hi>Amalekites;</hi> and the good ſpirit of the Lord left him, and he was rejected; but to paſs this and many ſuch inſtances which might be added if I had time; conſider this, If God have elected one ſort of men to Salvation, from whence they cannot fall, (before the foundation of the world) and reprobated another ſort, that cannot be ſaved: Then,</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Is not mans ruin from the Lord, if his decree were thus made before man was made, which ſo to affirm, were to affirm that which the Scripture denyeth, and ſo to put the lye upon God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, if that Doctrine be true, then to what end is preaching, and the like, for if the Elect were never preached unto, they cannot miſcarry; for their election ſtands ſure, and their Salvation is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and if they have all the preaching to in the world, it adds no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unto them, for the end of all means is Salvation, and that they have, whether they ever hear the ſound of the Goſpel yea or nay; and therefore if that opinion be true, preaching is but of very little uſe unto the Elect, for they ſhould have had Salvation if they had never heard of it.</p>
                     <p>And Secondly, it is no wayes beneficial to the reprobate, becauſe if he had all the preaching unto in the world, it would do him no good, (according to that opinion) becauſe he could never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered out of that eſtate and condition by it; ſo then that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is very dangerous; Firſt, becauſe it makes Gods decree the author of ſin, for where God decreeth the end, he decreeth the means lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the end.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it makes the preaching of the Word of God of none effect, for the Elect cannot periſh if they be never preached unto, and the reprobate cannot be recovered by all the preaching to in the world.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it deſtroyes all chriſtian aſſurance, and builds men upon qualifications and not upon promiſes; for this reaſon,</p>
                     <p>Becauſe if there be but a very ſmall number elected, and they are not diſtinguiſhed by name, but by qualification, then no man
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:119763:44"/>
can prove his election but by his qualification, and that is to build up men in themſelves, and not upon free grace in a promiſe, and ſo their election is many times queſtioned, when they are overtaken in temptation, and have not the fruits of election appearing in them, eſpecially when they conſider how great enjoyments and ſpiritual gifts, and heavenly taſtes men may attain unto, and yet may not be in the election.</p>
                     <p>And Fourthly, That opinion is the very fountain head (as I may ſay) of uncleanneſs, for what is the plea of wicked men when they are reproved for ſin; in ſhort thus, ſay they, if it had pleaſed God to have given me grace I ſhould have done as other men, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs if I be elected God will have a time to call me, for it is not in my power to do good of my ſelf; and if I be not elected, it is not my ſtriving and endeavours will do me any good; and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this corrupt Judgment, and corrupt mind, men give up themſelves up to walk in ſuch courſes, as the fleſh and carnal mind luſteth after.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, If that opinion be true, that God hath elected one ſort and reprobated another ſort, and that before the world was, then the wicked are damned for doing the will of God, as will plainly appear, for what God hath decreed to bring to paſs, he doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to do it by means; as firſt, to ſave the elect thorow holineſs, and to damn the wicked for their wickedneſs; and one he melts and ſofteneth that he may yeeld and be obedient, and the other he har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deneth, that he may be glorified in their deſtruction; and if God do harden mens hearts to do wickedly, is it not plain, that it is the will of God they ſhould ſo do, for God works all things according to the counſel of his own will; and then if ſo, that God harden them to do wickedly, and then deny them becauſe they do wickedly, doth not God damn the wicked for doing his will, or for the doing of what he appointed them to do: Let all Judge, for ſo ſay ſome, that men are appointed of God unto wickedneſs and diſobedience, from this ſcripture, 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 2.8. But how that can be evil or diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, for men to do what God hath appointed them to do, (as yet) I know not.</p>
                     <p>And Sixtly, and laſtly, If this opinion be true, then we may not blame the wicked for any of their wickedneſs, but conclude that the fault is in him, (if it be wickedneſs that they commit) that did decree it and appoint it to be done: and thus God by this vain and wicked opinion is made the author of all the wickedneſs which is
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:119763:44"/>
committed; and how dangerous it is, I leave the reader to judge, this ſhort word premiſed; and paſs to the next thing conſiderable; although I would have anſwered ſome Objections about this point, but becauſe I find none material cited by my Antagoniſt, but that which I have anſwered in my former Treatiſe; and alſo becauſe my time is very pretious at preſent, and calls for brevity; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall now come to ſpeak to the laſt Particular in order, which ſhall be the concluſion of this firſt part of my book, which is about the Kingdome of our bleſſed Saviour, and his Saints upon earth, finding but little Objections by any urged againſt the Jewes return out of their captivity, and none cited by my Antagoniſt worth ſpeaking to; and therefore I now come to prove, That Chriſt and the Saints, ſhall poſſeſs a Kingdome, and raign upon earth.</p>

                     <p>HEre is (comprehended) in this Subject of Diſcourſe, ſuch good newes, as will (doubtleſs) comfort the heart of every one that waits for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to be revealed from Heaven: which is the glorious eſtate of Chriſt, and the Saints upon earth, which hath been foretold by the mouths of the Prophets, and alſo of the Lord Chriſt himſelf, and his holy Apoſtles, that through their words, together with the holy Spirit ſent down from God into our hearts, (which bears witneſs to the ſame truth) we might have ſtrong conſolation, thorow lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold upon the hope ſet before us, and therein wait for the Son of God to be revealed from Heaven, who is heir of all things, even the world preſent, and that which is to come; thorow whom (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo) we have obtained (by promiſe) an inheritance, being predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to be made Kings and Prieſts, and to raign upon the earth; And in order to the clearing of this truth, I ſhall lay down this Point or Poſition; which is,</p>

                        <pb n="77" facs="tcp:119763:45"/>
                        <head>That Chriſt and the Saints are to receive and poſſeſs a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and raign upon Earth.</head>
                        <p>This I ſhall prove, firſt by plain text of Scripture; and ſecondly, by reaſons drawn from Scripture; and thirdly, the manner how Chriſt ſhall take the Kingdome; fourthly, a few words as touching the diſtance of time between the Reſurrection of the juſt and unjuſt; fifthly, the place of Chriſts Kingly ſeat; ſixthly, how long Chriſt ſhall raign, and the eſtate and condition of the wicked in the time of Chriſts raign.</p>
                        <p>And firſt to prove, That Chriſt and the Saints are to receive a Kingdome, and to raign upon earth; which is clear from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures proved, for ſo ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.13, 14, 18. in theſe words, <hi>And I ſaw in the night a viſion, and behold one like the ſon of man came with (or in) the cloudes of Heaven, and came to the ancient of dayes, and they brought him neer before him; and there was given him dominion and glory, and a Kingdome, that all People, Nations and languages, ſhould ſerve him; his dominion is an everlaſting dominion, which ſhall not paſs away, but the Saints of the moſt high ſhall poſſeſs the Kingdome for ever.</hi> From theſe words, we may ſafely conclude, That Chriſt and the Saints ſhall receive and poſſeſs a Kingdome, and raign, for ſo ſaith the Prophet <hi>Iſai.</hi> 32.1. in theſe words, <hi>Behold a King ſhall raign in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> (meaning the Chriſt,) <hi>and Princes,</hi> (meaning the Saints) <hi>ſhall rule in Judgment:</hi> To which alſo agreeth the words of the Prophet <hi>Obadiah,</hi> (verſ. 21.) which ſaith, <hi>And Saviours ſhall come upon Mount Zion, and Judge the mount of Eſau, when the kingdome ſhall be the Lords.</hi> And that this kingdome ſhall be upon earth, and the Saints raign with Chriſt there, you may take notice of theſe Scriptures for the proof, and ſo I ſhall paſs to the reaſons drawn from Scripture: the Scriptures are thus read; <hi>He maketh warr to ceaſe to the ends of the earth, he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the ſpear in ſunder: be ſtill and know that I am God, I will be exalted amongſt the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth; Clap your hands all ye people, ſhout to God with the voyce of triumph, for the Lord moſt high is exalted, he is exalted, he is a great King over all the earth, he ſhall ſubdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet: God is gone up with a ſhout, the Lord with the ſound of a trumpet; ſing praiſe to God, for God is the king of all the earth; God raigneth over the heathen, for the ſhield of the earth belongeth unto the Lord: for behold he
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:119763:46"/>
cometh to Judge the earth the Lord raigneth; &amp; bring thoſe mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that will not that I ſhall raign over them, and ſlay them before me, Pſal.</hi> 98.9. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 99.1. <hi>Luke.</hi> 19.14, 27. From theſe words we may ſee, that Chriſt and the Saints ſhall receive and poſſeſs a kingdome, and raign upon the earth; for it is plain from what hath been ſaid, that the ſhield of the earth belongeth unto Chriſt, and that he ſhall raign upon earth, the which as yet he never did, but was as a ſervant unto all men when he was upon earth, and did alſo ſuffer, which is a vaſt difference from raigning; but he ſhall take to himſelf his great power, and raign, and ſo ſhall his people, as they now ſuffer with Chriſt, or for Chriſt, ſo they ſhall raign with him; and that their raign ſhall be upon earth, read the word of the Lord for the proof of it, as you may find it written by Saint <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 5.9, 10. in theſe words, <hi>And they ſang a new ſong, ſaying, thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the ſeals thereof, for thou waſt ſlain and haſt redeemed us to God, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nations; and haſt made us unto our God, Kings and Preiſts, and we ſhall raign upon earth.</hi> From theſe words, (with the precedent) we may ſee, that Chriſt and the Saints ſhall receive a kingdome, and raign upon earth, the which proveth the truth of the Point before laid down, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That the raign of Chriſt and his People, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>But as touching the raign of Chriſt and his people, many will conſent to, but withall ſay, <hi>it is to be underſtood either ſpiritual here, or otherwiſe in Heaven.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>To which I anſwer and ſay, That the Saints ſhall not raign while they live in this mortal body is plain, becauſe the Scripture ſaith, <hi>that all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall ſuffer perſecution,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. And alſo, <hi>that thorow many tribulations, we muſt enter into the kingdome of God;</hi> and if ſo, then it is plain, that the Saints cannot be underſtood to raign here, becauſe here they are to fill up the ſufferings that are behind of Chriſt; and perſons cannot be ſaid to ſuffer and raign at one and the ſame time.</p>
                        <p>And ſecondly, there is not one Scripture that I at preſent know of, (nor I believe none elſe) which ſaith, that Chriſt and the Saints ſhall raign in Heaven; but the Scripture ſaith, that when the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator-ſhip ſhall be delivered up into the hands of the Father, then ſhall the Son himſelf be in ſubjection unto the Father, and then ſhall God himſelf be all in all: but it is plain, and I ſhall make it yet more plain, that the Scripture ſaith, That Chriſt and the Saints ſhall
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:119763:46"/>
raign upon earth. And now I ſhall come to give you the Reaſons of the Poſition or Point, before mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>That Chriſt with his Saints ſhall poſſeſs a Kingdome and raign up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth;</hi> and the firſt reaſon is,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. Becauſe the Scripture ſaith, it is a Kingdome under, and not a kingdome in heaven, as you may read in the Propheſie of <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.27. in theſe words, <hi>And the kingdome and dominion, and greatneſs of the kingdome, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NDER the whole heaven,</hi> (mark that) <hi>ſhall be given into the hands of the people of the Saints of the moſt high, whoſe kingdome is to be an everlaſting kingdome, and all do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions ſhall ſerve and obey him;</hi> From whence you may ſee, that there is a day a coming, that Chriſt and the Saints ſhall receive and poſſeſs the kingdome together, and raign under Heaven; and if it be under heaven, then it doth neceſſarily follow, that it will be upon earth; and this text agreeth with that which is ſpoken, by <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.34, 44. in theſe words; <hi>Thou ſaweſt till a ſtone was cut out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hands, which ſmote the Image upon his feet, that were of Iron and clay, and brake them in pieces; and in the dayes of theſe Kings ſhall the God of heaven ſet up a kingdome, which ſhall never be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; and the kingdome ſhall not be left unto another people, but it ſhall break in pieces, and conſume all theſe kingdoms, and ſhall ſtand for ever.</hi> And the ſtone ſhall become a great mountain, and fill the whole <hi>EARTH,</hi> (verſe. 35.) which meaneth, Chriſt and his people; from whence we may ſee, that the Kingdome that <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaks of, is to be upon earth, becauſe he ſaith, it was to fill the whole earth; ſo then Chriſt and the Saints are to receive a Kingdome, and to raign upon earth.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Secondly, the ſecond reaſon to prove, that Chriſt and the Saints ſhall receive a Kingdom and raign upon earth; is, Becauſe the Scripture ſaith, that Chriſt and the Saints ſhall rule the Nations with a Rod of Iron, and bruſe them like a Potters veſſel; the which cannot be unleſs Chriſt and the Saints receive a Kingdome and raign upon earth; for if the received opinion be true, that all ſhall ariſe together at the laſt day, and at a moment, or in a ſhort time, one go to Heaven and the other to Hell; how then can Chriſt and the Saints then rule the Nations with a Rod of Iron, and bruſe them like a Potters veſſel; for ſo long as the Saints live in this world, they muſt expect to ſuffer for Chriſt and the Goſpels ſake, as ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Daniel;</hi> and indeed many Prophets and Apoſtles, <hi>that thorow many tribulations we ſhalt enter into the kingdome of God, yea
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:119763:47"/>
every one that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall ſuffer perſecution:</hi> and as <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaith, <hi>The ſame Horn,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> Antichriſt) <hi>made warr with the Saints, and overcame them until the Judgment was ſet, and the time came that the Saints were to poſſeſs the Kingdome, Dan.</hi> 7.21, 25. <hi>Acts</hi> 14.22. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. And indeed the nigher to the end, there ſhall be bating one another, and betraying one another, and the People of God ſhall be hated of all men for Chriſts name ſake; and as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>in this world you ſhall have tribulation; for if they have perſecuted me, they will alſo perſecute you;</hi> and this was the portion of the primitive Saints, and will be the portion of the l<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ſt alſo; therefore in this corrupt body they do not raign, but the wicked rule them with rigour, but there is a time that Chriſt and the Saints ſhall raign over them, and rule them with a rod of Iron, and bruſe them like a Potters veſſel; which ſhews, that Chriſt and the Saints are to receive a Kingdome, and raign upon earth.</p>
                        <p>Now that they are to rule all Nations, read <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.8, 9. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.26, 27. (in <hi>Pſal</hi> 2.) the words are theſe, <hi>Thou art my ſon, this day have I begotten thee, ask of me and I will give thee the heathen for thy inheritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion; Thou ſhalt break them with a Rod of Iron, and than ſhalt daſh them in pieces like a Potters veſſel.</hi> Thus you ſee the honour and dignity that God hath given to his Son, namely, to rule the Nations with a Rod of Iron; and this very honour hath Chriſt given to the Saints, as you may read, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.26, 27. in theſe words, <hi>He that overcometh and keepeth my works to the end, I will give him power over the Nations, and he ſhall rule them with a Rod of Iron, and burſe them like a potters veſſel, even as I have received of my Father.</hi> Here we ſee the Scripture ſaith, that Chriſt and the Saints, ſhall rule the Nations with a Rod of Iron; which ſheweth, that Chriſt and the Saints, ſhall receive a Kingdome, and raign upon earth. And ſo I paſs to the third reaſon, why Chriſt and his Saints ſhall receive a Kingdome, and raign upon the earth; which is,</p>

                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. Becauſe the Scripture ſaith, that Chriſt and the Saints ſhall inherit the earth; now to live on the earth, and to have it or poſſeſs it (as their own inheritance) are two things; for <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſlaves lived in <hi>Canaan,</hi> but they had not the land in poſſeſſion; ſo was <hi>Abraham</hi> a ſojourner in the land, that afterwards he was to receive for an inheritance or poſſeſſion; even ſo it is with us, we
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:119763:47"/>
are ſtrangers and ſojourners in the earth, as was our fathers; and yet ſhall have it given into our hands for an inheritance, when it is reſtored into its glory; (I do not ſay we ſhall have no more, mistake not) For otherwiſe the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> loſt ſome happineſs or ſoverainty that Chriſt never reſtores; but that Chriſt and the Saints ſhall inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the earth, read theſe Scriptures diligently, which ſaith, <hi>He</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt) <hi>ſhall come down as rain upon the new mown graſs, as ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that watereth the earth; and in that day ſhall the righteous flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and abundance of peace ſo long as the Moon endureth; his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion ſhall be from Sea to Sea, from the rivers unto the ends of the earth;</hi> Thus Chriſt ſhall come down and inherit the earth; <hi>They that dwell in the wilderneſs ſhall bow before him, and his enemies ſhall lick the duſt; yea all Kings ſhall fall down before him, all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall ſerve him.</hi> Hence we ſee, that Chriſt is to inherit the earth, and the Nations to ſerve him; and now you ſhall ſee that the Saints ſhall inherit the earth alſo, and that Kings ſhall bow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and they ſhall bind them in chains and fetters of Iron, for ſo ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Bleſſed are the meek for they ſhall inherit the earth; and the high praiſes of God be in their mouths, and a two edged ſword in their hands, to execute vengeance upon the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and puniſhment upon the people; to bind their Kings with chains, and their Nobles with fetters of Iron; to execute upon them the Judgment written; this honour hath all the Saints,</hi> (mark that) <hi>praiſe ye the Lord;</hi> therefore <hi>wait upon God and keep his wayes, and he will exalt thee to inherit the earth, when the wicked are cut off, thou ſhalt ſee it; For yet a little while and the wicked ſhall not be,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> bear rule) <hi>but the meek ſhall inherit the earth, and delight themſelves in the abundance of peace; for evil doers ſhall be cut off, but thoſe that wait upon the Lord ſhall inherit the earth.</hi> Hence we ſee, that Chriſt and the Saints, are to inherit the earth, and to exerciſe authority in government over Kings, and this honour is not peculiar to a few of the Saints only; but it belongs to all of them, even to the beggar upon the dunghil; for <hi>this honour hath ALL the Saints, praiſe ye the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 149.8, 9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.5.6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.9, 10, 11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.5. From which reaſon and Scriptures appeareth plainly, that Chriſt and the Saints are to receive a Kingdome and raign upon earth. And ſo I paſs to the fourth reaſon, to prove that Chriſt and the Saints ſhall receive a Kingdom, and raign upon earth; which is,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. Becauſe God hath promiſed to reſtore the Kingdom to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and their Judges as at the firſt, which were men that judged
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:119763:48"/>
them in righteouſneſs, even holy men; and Chriſt ſheweth us, that he and thoſe that obey him, are to be Judges over the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> now this is not to be underſtood in a ſpiritual ſenſe; that is to ſay, that there were to be ſome of the twelve Tribes converted, and Chriſt to rule over them; for hear we ſee the Saints ſhall judge them, that is meant be governors, as the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es at the firſt; which cannot be taken in ſuch a ſenſe, for the Saints are not to exerciſe authority one over another (as conſidered in one and the ſame body) as ſaith Chriſt, <hi>The Lords of the Gentiles exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe authority, and they that are cheef bear rule; but amongſt you it ſhall not be ſo; but he that is greateſt let him be your ſervant;</hi> But that the Saints with Chriſt ſhall receive a Kingdome and judge the twelve Tribes, read <hi>Luke</hi> 22.28, 29, 30. in theſe words, <hi>Ye are they that have continued with me in my temptations, and I appoint unto you a Kingdome as my father hath appointed unto me; that ye may eat and drink with me at my table in my Kingdome, and ſit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Thrones Judging the twelve Tribes of Iſrael:</hi> And (as before ſaid) this honour ſhall all the Saints have, and therefore ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (to the <hi>Corinths,</hi>) <hi>Know ye not that the Saints ſhall judge the world,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2, 4. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.28, 29, 30. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.26. Theſe Scriptures with many more that I could add (only I ſtudy brevity) proveth; that Chriſt and the Saints are to receive a Kingdome up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, and raign and Judge the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And ſo I paſs to the fifth reaſon to prove, that Chriſt and the Saints are to receive a Kingdome, and raign upon the earth; which is,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. Becauſe the Scripture ſaith, that <hi>the Kingdomes of this world are</hi> (to) <hi>become the Kingdomes of the Lord and his Chriſt, and he to take his great power and to raign;</hi> and it is a true and a <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſaying, that thoſe that ſuffer with Chriſt, ſhall raign with him:</hi> but to prove that the Kingdomes of this world, ſhall become Chriſts kingdome, and he to take his great power and to raign, read <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15, 16, 17, 18. in theſe words, <hi>And the ſeventh Angel ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and there was a great voice in heaven, ſaying, the kingdoms of this world, are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall raign for ever and ever; and the four and twenty Elders which ſate before God on their ſeats, fell upon their face and worſhipped God; ſaying, we give thee thanks O Lord God almighty, which art, and waſt, and art to come; becauſe thou haſt taken to thee thy great power, and haſt raigned; and the Nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead that they ſhould be judged;
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:119763:48"/>
and that thou ſhouldeſt give a reward unto thy ſervants, the Prophets, &amp; to the Saints, and to them that fear thy name ſmall and great, and ſhould deſtroy them which deſtroyed the earth.</hi> From theſe words, we may ſee theſe particulars laid down: Firſt, that the Kingdomes of this World, are to be the Kingdomes of Chriſt at the ſound of the ſeventh trumpet; read my <hi>Vindication of Zions Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Original Sin;</hi> where you ſhall find the effect of the ſeventh trumpet, the which at preſent I ſhall not ſpeak to in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; but know that there is a ſet time, that the Kingdomes of this World, is to become the kingdomes of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>But peradventure ſome will ſay, was there a time when the Kingdomes of this World were not Chriſts.</p>
                        <p>I anſwer, yea, for although Chriſt was born King of the Jewes, and by his deſcent (according to the fleſh) was to be King (as the Lord ſhewed the wiſe men that came from the Eaſt to worſhip him) yet Chriſt tells <hi>Pilate,</hi> that his Kingdome was not (then) of this World, for he was firſt to ſuffer, and afterwards to receive a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and raign; ſo that there is a ſet time when the Kingdomes of this World ſhall be given into the hands of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>And ſecondly, <hi>the Nations were angry, and his wrath,</hi> and fury came up into his face, &amp; he took his great power and did raign. From whence we may ſee, that although Chriſt never was without pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, yet there is a ſet time for his exerciſing of it, which is imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the word, <hi>TOOK</hi> his great power and did raign.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, it is the time that the dead ſhall be judged, (that is the dead in Chriſt) and then he ſhall give the reward to his ſervants the Prophets, and all that fear his name ſmall and great.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, He will deſtroy them which deſtroyed the earth, and make warr to ceaſe from the ends of the earth, and <hi>they ſhall beat their Swords into Plow-ſhears, and their Spears into pruning hooks,</hi> for there ſhall be <hi>abundance of peace ſo long as the Moon endureth.</hi> So then there is a ſet time for Chriſt to take his great power and to raign, and for the Kingdomes of this world, to become the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of our Lord and his Chriſt. From whence we may ſee, that Chriſt and the Saints are to receive and poſſeſs a Kingdome, and raign upon earth; and ſo I paſs to the ſixth reaſon, to prove Chriſt and the Saints to have a Kingdome, and raign upon earth; which is,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 6. Sixthly, Becauſe the Tabernacle of God, ſhall be with men, and he ſhall dwell with them; now this very word (the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:119763:49"/>
Tabernacle with men, and he dwell with them) implyeth, that Chriſt ſhall come again, and dwell upon earth, for ſo is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon that Chriſt made, while he was upon earth, that the Son of man was like to a certain Noble man, that went to receive a Kingdome, and to return, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. verſe 11, 12, 13. From whence we may ſee, that Chriſt is to return again as he alſo hath ſaid, <hi>I will come unto you again, and your hearts ſhall rejoyce, and your joy no man ſhall take from you;</hi> but as for this, I ſhall ſhew more at large anon, only that you may ſee, that the Tabernacle of God ſhall be with men, and he dwell with them, read <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.3. in theſe words, <hi>And I heard a great voyce out of heaven, ſaying, Behold, the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people, and God himſelf ſhall be with them, and be their God. O let the Nations be glad, and ſing for joy, for thou ſhalt Judge the people righteouſly, and govern the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon the earth;</hi> (Selah.) <hi>Then ſhall the earth yeeld her increaſe, and God even our God, ſhall bleſs us, and all the ends of the earth ſhall fear him; for the Lord ſhall be King over all the earth.</hi> From theſe Scriptures we may ſee, that the Lord is to dwell with men, even to come down and dwell with them; it is not ſaid, that man ſhall dwell with God, implying a removing of their place, but the Tabernacle of God to be with men, and he to dwell with them; implying, that God will remove his habitation.</p>
                        <p>But peradventure ſome may ſay, will the Lord come and dwell with us upon a corrupt carnal earth?</p>
                        <p>To which I anſwer, and firſt, Chriſt did dwell with his Diſciples upon the earth, and eat with them after his Reſurrection, (what will that teach us, weigh it well.) But ſecondly, the earth then ſhall be more pure then the Heavens are now, for the earth ſhall be clean in his ſight, and very good as he at firſt made them; when the reſtorer ſhall have reſtored all things, for then the curſe will be taken away; but as ſaith <hi>Eliphaz, Job</hi> 15.15. The heavens are not clean in his ſight; I might ſpeak of Gods dislike of it by reaſon of the Angels transgreſſion.</p>
                        <p>But you will ſay, there ſhall be a new heaven as well as a new earth.</p>
                        <p>I anſwer it is true, where ever Gods ſeat is, there is Heaven, but Gods ſeat ſhall then be upon earth in Jeruſalem, where he was ſhadowed out of old, and hence Jeruſalem is called (by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.17, 18, 19.) the new Heaven, in theſe words, <hi>Behold.
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:119763:49"/>
I create a new Heaven, and a new Earth, and the former ſhall not be remembred, nor come into mind; but be you glad and rejoyce for ever, in that which I create; for behold I create Jeruſalem a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, and her people a joy, and I will rejoyce in Jeruſalem and joy in my people; and the voyce of weeping ſhall be heard no more in her, nor the voyce of crying.</hi> From theſe words we may ſee, what is to be underſtood by the new Heaven and new Earth, ſpoken of in the 21 <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>Revel.</hi> and what is to be underſtood of the Tabernacle of God being with men, and he to dwell with them, even the Lord of Hoſts in his holy mountain at Jeruſalem; <hi>And Saviours ſhall come upon mount Zion,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> Saints) <hi>to Judge the mount of Eſau, when the Kingdome ſhall be the Lords:</hi> and ſo I paſs to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Reaſon, to prove that Chriſt and the Saints ſhall receive a Kingdom, and raign upon earth; which is,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 7. Seventhly, Becauſe Chriſt hath commanded us to pray for it, <hi>even that his Kingdom might come, that his will might be done in Earth as it is in Heaven;</hi> For there is a time coming, that it ſhall be ſo, and the earth ſhall be full of the knowledg of the Lord, as water covereth the Sea, when the Law ſhall go forth of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and the word of the Lord from Jeruſalem; now till that day, there will be weakneſs and imperfection amongſt the godly, that the will of God ſometimes will be oppoſed and reſiſted, but at that time there ſhall be no ſin or diſobedience amongſt the godly; for <hi>if they ſeek for ſin in Judah, there ſhall be none found;</hi> for <hi>they ſhall defile themſelves no more with any of their deteſtable things;</hi> for <hi>all the ends of the earth ſhall remember and turn unto the Lord, and all the kindreds of the Nations, ſhall worſhip before thee, for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms is the Lords, he is the governour amonſt the Nations, Pſal.</hi> 22.27, 28. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 37. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Micah</hi> 4. From hence we may ſee, that Chriſt is to have a Kingdom, and raign and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Nations upon the earth, at which time his will ſhall be done upon earth, as the Angels do it in Heaven; and this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom alſo is the Saints, it being the good pleaſure of the Father, to give it unto them, as ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Luke,</hi> 12.32. So then Chriſt and the Saints are to receive a Kingdom and raign upon earth. And ſo I paſs to the eighth reaſon, to prove Chriſt and his Saints to raign upon earth; which is,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 8. Eightly, Becauſe the Scripture ſaith, that God will <hi>raiſe up unto David a righteous branch,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt) <hi>who ſhall have the Government upon his ſhoulders, and execute Judgment and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:119763:50"/>
Juſtice in the earth;</hi> (mark that) <hi>and in his dayes Judah ſhall be ſaved;</hi> (which yet is not) <hi>and Iſrael ſhall dwell ſafely;</hi> and the Saints ſhall ſhout for joy, and the wicked ſhall be as aſhes under the ſoles of their feet; for God will <hi>make Zion (as) a threſhing of Iron, having teeth, which ſhall beat the mountains</hi> (of opoſition) <hi>into duſt; and the little hills into powder.</hi> And that there ſhall be ſuch a righteous branch riſe up to <hi>David,</hi> who ſhall give his people reſt, and a Kingdom and dominion, that they may raign with him upon earth, read theſe Scriptures and peruſe them well, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.5, 6. in theſe words, <hi>Behold the day cometh ſaith the Lord, that I will raiſe up unto David a righteous branch, and a King ſhall raign and proſper, and ſhall execute Judgment and Juſtice in the EARTH; in his day Judah ſhall be ſaved, and Iſrael ſhall dwell ſafely, and this is the name whereby he ſhall be called, THE LORD O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R RIGHTE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SNESSE.</hi> From theſe words we ſee, that the Son of <hi>David,</hi> (namely the Lord Chriſt our Righteouſneſs) is to be King, and that over all the earth, to execute Judgment and Juſtice therein, and at that time (or in the dayes of his raign) <hi>Judah</hi> ſhall be ſaved, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall dwell ſafely; that is, God will reſtore (as before ſaid) their Judges as at the firſt, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Saints) who will judge them in righteouſneſs, for <hi>the ſhield of the earth belongeth unto the Lord;</hi> for ſo ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6, 7. in theſe words, <hi>For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given, and the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall be upon his ſhoulder, and his name ſhall be called, Wounder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Counſellor, the mighty God, the everlaſting Father, the Prince of peace; of the increaſe of his government and peace there ſhall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his Kingdom to order it, and to eſtabliſh it with Judgment and with Juſtice, from henceforth even for ever.</hi> From whence we ſee, that if <hi>Davids</hi> Kingdome was upon earth, then Chriſt will have a Kingdom upon earth, for it is to be upon the throne of his Father <hi>David,</hi> and that is the ſure mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of <hi>David,</hi> that he was never to want a man to ſit upon his throne; meaning that Chriſt was to ſit there; but more of that anon. Hence you may ſee, that Chriſt is to receive a Kingdom and raign upon earth, and his Saints with him, for they are joynt heirs; that in ſuffering with him, they may alſo be glorified toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and raign with him according to the Scriptures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. And ſo I paſs to the ninth Reaſon, to prove that Chriſt and the Saints, ſhall receive a Kingdom and raign upon earth.</p>

Ninthly, Becauſe the Scripture ſaith, That God <hi>will ſend Jeſus Chriſt, whom the Heavens muſt retain until the times of Reſtitution of all things,</hi> (<hi>Act.</hi> 3.19, 20, 21.) and that he ſhall <hi>take the Kingdom</hi> out of the hands of the wicked, and give it into the hands of the Saints, according to <hi>Daniels</hi> words, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.14, 18, 22. where he as King, and they as Princes, ſhall raign in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.1. and Kings ſhall bow before Chriſt and them, and lick up the duſt of their feet; and Kings ſhall miniſter unto them, that is, ſerve them, or be ſervants unto them; peruſe theſe Scriptures well, and ſo I ſhall haſten to the tenth and laſt Reaſon, and alſo to a concluſion as to this Subject of Diſcourſe, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are theſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.10, 11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.29. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.5. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.7, 23. <hi>Chap.</hi> 60.10, 11, 12. and thus it is written; <hi>Princes ſhall come out of Egypt, Ethiopia ſhall ſoon ſtretch out her hands to God, becauſe of thy Temple at Jeruſalem; Kings ſhall bring preſents unto thee, they that dwell in the Wilderneſs ſhall bow before him, and his enemies ſhall lick the duſt: The Kings of Tarſhiſh, and of the Iſles ſhall bring preſents: the Kings of Sheba, and Seba</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> Ethiopia and Arabia) <hi>ſhall offer gifts; Yea all Kings ſhall fall down before him, all nations ſhall ſerve him: The Lord ſaid to my Lord, ſit thou at my right hand until I make thy enemies thy foot-ſtool: the Lord ſhall ſend the rod of thy ſtrength out of Zion,</hi> (mark that) <hi>rule thou in the middeſt of thine enemies: The Lord at thy right hand ſhall ſtrike thorow Kings in the day of his wrath, he ſhall Judge amongſt the heathen, he ſhall fill the places with the dead bodies, he ſhall wound the head over many countries; He hath ſhewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the Heritage of the Heathen,</hi> (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.6.) <hi>For thus ſaith the Lord, the redeemer of Iſrael and his holy one, to him whom man deſpiſeth; to him whom the nations abhorreth, to a ſervant of rulers; Kings ſhall ſee and ariſe, Princes alſo ſhall worſhip, becauſe of the Lord that is faithful, and the holy one of Iſrael, and he ſhall chuſe thee; and they ſhall bow down with their faces towards the earth, and lick up the duſt of thy feet; and thou ſhalt know that I am the Lord, for they ſhall not be aſhamed that wait for me.</hi> For <hi>Kings ſhall miniſter unto thee, for the nation or Kingdome that will not ſerve thee, ſhall periſh, yea thoſe nations ſhall be utterly waſted.</hi> From theſe Scriptures (with many move that I might add if time would give way to it) we may ſee, that God will take away the Kingdomes and Dominions out of the hands of the wicked heathens,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:119763:51"/>
and give them into the hands of Chriſt and the Saints, that they may poſſeſs the heritage of the heathen, (of which the taking the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> of old was a type) and ſo Kings to fall down before them; this honour ſhall Chriſt have, and all the Saints praiſe ye the Lord. And thus I come to the tenth and laſt Reaſon that I ſhall give at preſent, (although many more might be given) to prove, that Chriſt and the Saints ſhall receive a Kingdome, and raign upon earth; which is,</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 10. Becauſe the Scripture ſaith, that there is a world to come to be put in ſubjection to Chriſt and the Saints, now the word <hi>WORLD,</hi> preſuppoſeth the eſtate of things as at preſent in this world; namely, an inhabitance of men and beaſts, and of all creatures; ſo as <hi>Adam</hi> had all things put into ſubjection, ſo (alſo) ſhall the whole creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be reſtored to their former dignity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. only the Serpent excepted, and ſuch men as ſell their inheritance by their ſins, as <hi>Eſau</hi> did his: But becauſe I muſt be brief, I ſhall now give the Scriptures to prove, that Chriſt and the Saints are to have a world to come put in ſubjection unto them, which cannot be meant in heaven; for I have already ſhewed, that they ſhall not have that ſubjected to them, but Chriſt and the Saints at that time, (<hi>viz.</hi> after the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator-ſhip is delivered up to God) ſhall be in ſubjection themſelves, as you may ſee, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24, 25, 26, 27, 28. So then they having the promiſe of a world to come, to be put in ſubjection under them, implyeth clearly, that Chriſt and the Saints ſhall raign up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth, or to have a world to come to raign in; or the Kingdoms of this world to be altered and become the Kingdoms of Chriſt, and the Saints, as I before have proved: but to the proof; that Chriſt and the Saints are to have a world to come, ſubjected under them, read and peruſe theſe Scriptures, and the Lord grant to open thy underſtanding; the Scriptures are thus read unto thee, <hi>For unto the Angels hath he not put into ſubjection the world to come, whereof we ſpeak, but one in a certain place teſtified, ſaying, what is man that thou art mindful of him, or the Son of Man that thou ſhouldeſt viſit him? Thou haſt put all things in ſubjection under his feet; for in that he hath put all things in ſubjection under him, he left nothing that is not put under him; but now we ſee not yet all things put under him, but he ſhall ſubdue the people under us, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under our feet; For whether Paul or Apollo, or Cephas, or the World, or life, or death, or things preſent, or things to come,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:119763:51"/>
all are yours, and you are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods. And the Saints ſhall take the Kingdome and poſſeſs it for ever, neither ſhall it be given into the hands of another people for ever;</hi> from whence we may ſee, that Chriſt and the Saints are to receive a Kingdome and Raign upon Earth. And ſo I paſs to the next Particular, ſaying, that I have given thee but a dram at preſent, for what I might give, (as to this Subject of diſcourſe) if time had not prevented me, but I hope that what hath been ſaid here, being ſeriouſly read and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will bring other Scriptures into thy mind; and ſo citing the Texts before read unto thee, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.5, 6, 8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.18. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.44.

                        <p>As touching the Battel of the great day of the God Almighty. We find that the Prophets (as well as the Apocalepſe) do bear their Teſtimony unto the truth thereof, ſo that I need not uſe much cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumlocution or argument to prove it, yet in order to the clearing of the matter, I ſhall lay down this point as a ground of the dicourſe; which is,</p>
                        <p>That there will be ſuch a great ſlaughter at the coming of Chriſt (to take and poſſeſs the Kingdome) that the very Fouls of the Heavens, ſhall be filled with the fleſh and bloud of Captaines, and great men of the earth.</p>
                        <p>For thus ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39.17, 18. <hi>And thou ſon of man, thus ſaith the Lord God, ſpeak unto every feathered foul, and to every beaſt of the field, Aſſemble your ſelves, and come gather your ſelves on every ſide to my ſacrifice, that I do ſacrifice for you, even a great ſacrifice upon the mountains of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>that ye may eat fleſh and drink blood. Ye ſhall eat the fleſh of the mighty, and drink the blood of the Princes of the earth, and ye ſhall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye be drunken, of my ſacrifice which I have ſacrificed for you. And all the heathen ſhall ſee my Judgment, that I have exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, and my hand that I have laid upon them.</hi> Revel. 19.17. <hi>And I ſaw an Angel ſtanding in the Sun, and he cryed with a loud voyce, ſaying, to all the fouls that flie in the midſt of Heaven, come and gather your ſelves together unto the Supper of the great God. That ye may eat the fleſh of Kings, and the fleſh of Captains, and the fleſh of mighty men, and the fleſh of horſes, and of them that ſit on them, and the fleſh of all men ſmall and great, bond and free.</hi> From theſe
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:119763:52"/>
Scriptures you may ſee, that there is to be a very great ſlaughter at the time when the Lord Chriſt ſhall take his Kingdome to Raign up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth; and ſeveral Prophets alſo bear their teſtimony to this thing, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 34.5, 6. <hi>Joel</hi> 2.1, 2, 3, 4. But becauſe of the want of time I paſs to the reaſons of the point.</p>

                           <hi>Reaſon</hi> 1. Becauſe the Scripture ſaith, that God will give him, (<hi>viz.</hi> Chriſt) the heathen for his inheritance, and he ſhall bruiſe them like a potters veſſel, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. and we alſo ſee what the Pſalmiſt ſaith of Chriſts victory over his enemies, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.5. <hi>The Lord at thy right hand ſhall ſtrike thorow Kings in the day of his wrath, he ſhall Judge amongſt the heathen, he ſhall fill the places with the dead bodies, he ſhall wound the heads over many Countries; for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I will tread them down in my anger, and trample them in my fury, and their blood ſhall be ſprinkled upon my garments, and I will ſtain all my rayment, for the day of vengeance is in my heart, and the year of my redeemed is come:</hi> from whence we ſee, that Chriſt is not only to take the Kingdomes of the whole World into his hands, but alſo to trample the wicked as aſhes under the ſoles of his feet: and ſo I paſs to the ſecond reaſon.</p>

                           <hi>Reaſon</hi> 2. Becauſe the Lord hath ſaid, that the deſtruction of the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the man of ſin or Antichriſt) ſhall be like the ſlaughter of <hi>Midian</hi> at the Rock <hi>Orib, Iſa.</hi> 10.24, 25, 26. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus ſaith the Lord God of Hoſts, O my people that dwell in Zion! be not afraid of the Aſſyrian, he ſhall ſmite thee with a Rod, and ſhall lift up his ſtaff againſt thee after the manner of Egypt; for yet a very little while, and the indignation ſhall ceaſe, and mine anger in their deſtruction, and the Lord of Hoſts ſhall ſtir up a ſcourge for him, according to the ſlaughter of Midian at the Rock Orib:</hi> now that you may underſtand, what that ſlaughter was, you may read, <hi>Judg.</hi> 7.22. Where we find that the Lord ſet every mans hand againſt his brother, ſo that they deſtroyed each other, with a very great ſlaughter, and ſo it will be in the day of the Lord, for when they ſee the great unavoydable judgments which ſhall overtake them, and that the mountains will be too narrow a covering for them: then will their indignation be kindled one againſt another, ſo as to deſtroy each other, as you may ſee from that type in the dayes of <hi>Gideon,</hi> and alſo from the words of the Prophet <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38.18, 19, 20, 21, 22. which ſaith, <hi>&amp; it ſhall come to paſs at the ſame time, when Gogg ſhall come up againſt the Land of Iſrael, ſaith the Lord God, that my fury ſhall come up in my face. For in my jealouſie, and in the fire of my
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:119763:52"/>
wrath have I ſpoken: Surely in that day ſhall there be a great ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the Land of Iſrael. So that the fiſh of the Sea, and the fouls of the heaven, and the beaſts of the field, and all creeping things that creepeth upon the earth, and all men that are upon the face of the earth, ſhall ſhake at my preſence; and the mountains ſhall be thrown down, and the ſteep places ſhall fall, and every wall ſhall fall to the ground. And I will call for a ſword againſt him thorow all my mountains, ſaith the Lord God; every mans ſword ſhall be againſt his brother. And I will plead againſt him with peſtilence, and with blood, and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the many people that are with him, an overflowing rain, and great hailſtones, fire and brimſtome; Thus will I magnifie wy ſelf,</hi> (and ſo forth.) from theſe words with the Prophet, <hi>Zach.</hi> 14.13. We may ſee that there will be a very great ſlaughter upon <hi>Gogg</hi> and his Army, at the time when the Lord Chriſt ſhall diſpoſſeſs him of his great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and authority, and it will be like to that ſlaughter of <hi>Gideon,</hi> which was called the ſword of the Lord, and the ſword of <hi>Gideon, Judg.</hi> 7.18.</p>

                           <hi>Reaſon</hi> 3. That there is to be ſuch a great ſlaughter, is clear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is to be like the great ſlaughter of <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> upon <hi>Moab, Ammon, and</hi> Mount <hi>Seir,</hi> (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.22, 23, 24.) which was a very great ſlaughter, as you may read in the fore cited text; and that this ſlaughter was a type of the ſlaughter that ſhall be at the time when Chriſt ſhall take the Kingdome, you may ſee what <hi>Joel</hi> ſaith to this, <hi>Joel</hi> 3.1, 12, 13. <hi>For behold in thoſe dayes, and in that time when I ſhall bring again the Captivity of Judah, and Jeruſalem, I will gather all Nations, and will bring them down unto the valley of Jehoſhaphat, and will plead with them there; let the heathen be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakned, and come up to the valley of Jehoſhaphat; for there will I ſit to Judge the heathen round about; proclaim ye amongſt the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, prepare war, beat your Plowſhears into ſwords, and your pruning hooks into ſpears, put you in the ſickle for the harveſt is ripe; and the Angel thruſt in his ſickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and caſt it into the great winepreſs of the wrath of God, and the winepreſs was troden without the City, and blood came out of the winepreſs even to the horſe bridles, by the ſpace of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and ſix hundred furlongs, Revel.</hi> 14.19, 20. From whence we may ſee, that there is to be a very great ſlaughter in and amongſt the Army of <hi>Gogg,</hi> and <hi>Magog;</hi> I could cite many ſuch like texts, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly time ſuffereth me not, but I paſs to the fourth reaſon.</p>

                           <hi>Reaſon</hi> 4. Becauſe it is to be the year of vengeance, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for the controverſie of Zion, that as the Church of God, and alſo the <hi>Jews</hi> have been ſpoiled; ſo for a reward God will give their enemies into their hands, &amp; they ſhall ſpoil them by whom they were ſpoiled; ſo that Zion ſhall be as a thraſhing inſtrument of Iron, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing teeth that ſhall beat the mountains into duſt, and the little hills into pouder, for God will ſhew his indignation upon the Nations, and his fury upon the Armies, as ſaith the Lord by the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 34.1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8. in theſe words, <hi>Come neer ye nations to hear, and hearken ye people: let the earth hear, and all that is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the world, and all things that come forth of it. For the indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord is upon all nations, and his fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly deſtroyed them, he hath delivered them unto the ſlaughter. For my ſword ſhall be bathed in heaven: behold, I will come down to</hi> Idumea, <hi>and upon the people of my curſe to Judgment. The ſword of the Lord is filled with blood; it is made fat with fatneſs, and with the blood of Lambs and Goats, with the fat of the kidneys of Ramms: for the Lord hath a ſacrifice in</hi> Bozrah, <hi>and a great ſlaughter in the land of</hi> Idumea. <hi>For it is the day of the Lords ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and the year of recompence, for the controverſie of Zion.</hi> From whence we may ſee, that although Gods people do ſuffer at preſent, and are to ſuffer until the day of redemption; yet at that day, even when the Lord ſhall appear, although it be the time of <hi>Jacobs</hi> trouble, yet they ſhall be delivered, and the wicked ſhall come in their ſtead; that is, they ſhall then be in very great trouble; and ſo I paſs to the fifth Reaſon.</p>

                           <hi>Reaſon</hi> 5. Becauſe Gods determination is to gather the nations, and aſſemble the kingdomes, that he may pour upon them the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his indignation; and that it is to be at that day, read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.1, 2, 3. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.23. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38.19. <hi>Micah</hi> 4.12, 13. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33. From theſe Scriptures, we may ſee the great ſlaughter that will be at the time aforeſaid, which indeed the Prophets have ſpoken fully to; and becauſe I have given you an account of it in my former Treatiſe, I ſhall paſs it at preſent, and come to the next thing, which is, a few words as touching the diſtance of time between the reſurrection of the juſt and unjuſt.</p>
                        <p>

                        </p>
                        <p>As to the the proof of this ſubject of diſcourſe, I ſhall be brief, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:119763:53"/>
circumlocution, and only give you plain proof of Scripture, (although I might give many reaſons.) And firſt we may ſee that our bleſſed Saviour doth affirm it, (when he ſpeaks of his ſecond coming to raiſe the dead, and to take up the quick into the clouds) ſaying that, <hi>Of that day and hour, knoweth no man, no not the Angels in Heaven, but my Father only; but as the dayes of</hi> Noah <hi>was, ſo ſhall be the coming of the Son of man, for in the dayes before the floud, they were eating and drinking, marrying, and giving into mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, until the day that</hi> Noah <hi>entred into the</hi> Ark, <hi>and knew not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the floud came and took them all away; ſo alſo ſhall the coming of the ſon of man be. Then ſhall two be in the field, the one SHALL BE TAKEN, and the other ſhall BE LEFT; two women ſhall be grinding at the mill, the one SHALL BE TAKEN, and the other LEFT; two ſhall be in one bed, the one ſhall be taken, and the other ſhall be left, Mat.</hi> 24.36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41. compared with <hi>Luke</hi> 17.34. And that this ſpeaks of the taking up of the faithful that are alive, and leaving the unfaithful behind upon the earth, and raiſing of the dead that are faithful, and leaving the reſt of dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind that are unfaithful, is further cleared by the words of <hi>Paul,</hi> to the <hi>Theſſalonions.</hi> 4.15, 16, 17. which ſaith, <hi>For this we ſay unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive, and remain unto the coming of the Lord, ſhall not prevent them that are aſleep. For the Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend from heaven with a ſhout, with the voyce of the Archangel, and with the trump of God, and the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe FIRST. Then we which are alive, and remain, ſhall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the ayre: and ſhall be for ever with the Lord.</hi> From theſe words we may ſee the words of Chriſt are explained, where he ſaith, <hi>two ſhall be in one bed, the one taken, the other left,</hi> which is (ſaith <hi>Paul</hi>) at his <hi>COMING,</hi> that ſuch as ſleep in the Lord, will Chriſt ariſe <hi>FIRST,</hi> to bring with him, and alſo the quick that are faithful ſhall be caught up with them, and the reſt to be left behind, and the reſt of the dead alſo not to live again until a certain juncture of time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of God, as you ſhall ſee more anon; but hence you ſee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out controverſie, that the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt, as well as the faithful that are alive ſhall be caught away, and the other (<hi>viz.</hi> the wicked) left behind. And now I come to the next thing, which is, the laſt that I ſhall ſay to this ſubject, that is, How long the juſt ſhall riſe before the unjuſt; which is the whole time of Chriſts hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Kingdome, which is, the tearm of a thouſand years; and that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:119763:54"/>
you may ſee the truth of this, read <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.4, 5, 6. in theſe words, <hi>And I ſaw thrones, and they that ſate upon them, and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given unto them, and I ſaw the ſouls of them that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed for the witneſs of Jeſus, and the word of God, and they lived, &amp; raigned with Chriſt a thouſand years; But the reſt of the dead lived not again, until the thouſand years were fulfilled. This is the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection:</hi> or (indeed) as we may (fitly ſay) the Reſurrection of the firſt, or juſt: that both from Chriſts words, and <hi>Pauls,</hi> and alſo Jeſus, we may ſee that the godly ſhall ariſe a thouſand years at the leaſt before the wicked to poſſeſs a Kingdome, and to raign upon earth, the which glory God hath prepared for thoſe that love and obey Chriſt, and walk in his Ordinances, and keep them to the end; and thus I briefly paſs to the fifth particular, which is the place of Chriſts Kingly Seat.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, As to the place of Chriſts Kingly Seat, the Scriptures ſeem to be very clear in making of it out to be at the (former) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved place <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is to be built, and inhabited as of old time, the which in another Treatiſe I have fully proved, that <hi>Zion</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is the beloved place of the Lord, where Chriſts Throne is to be eſtabliſhed, in the place where <hi>Davids</hi> Throne was, for ſo ſaith the Scriptures as you may read, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6, 7. In theſe words, <hi>For unto us a child is born, unto us a Son is given, and the government ſhall be upon his ſhoulders, &amp; his name ſhall be called Wonderful Counſellor, the mighty God, the everlaſting Father, the Prince of peace. Of the increaſe of his government and peace there ſhall be no end, upon the THRONE OF DAVID, and upon HIS KINGDOME to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, and to eſtabliſh it with Judgment, and with Juſtice, from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth even for ever, the zeal of the Lord of hoſts will perform it; then ſhall the Sun be aſhamed, and the Moon confounded, when the Lord of hoſts ſhall raign IN MO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NT ZION, AND IN JER<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LEM, before his ancients gloriouſly, Iſa.</hi> 24.23. From theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures you may ſee, that Chriſts Throne is to be in Mount <hi>Zion</hi> in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> in the time of his raign; as,</p>
                        <p>Firſt, becauſe God himſelf hath declared it by the Spirit of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie in <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 2.6, 7. <hi>Yet will I ſet my King upon my holy hill of Sion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, it is a Doctrine preached by the Angel to the <hi>Virgin Mary, Luke</hi> 1.30.31, 32. In theſe words, <hi>And the Angel ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, fear not</hi> Mary, <hi>for thou haſt found favour with God. And beh<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                                 <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:119763:54"/>
ſhalt call his name Jeſus, he ſhall be great, and be called the Son of the higheſt, and the Lord ſhall give unto him the THRONE OF HIS FATHER DAVID,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is to be called the Throne of the Lord, as faith the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.17.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, The Lord himſelf ſaith, that he will dwell there, <hi>Zach.</hi> 8.3. In theſe words, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell in the midſt of Jeruſalem, and Jeruſalem ſhall be called a City of truth;</hi> it is a Propheſie of the laſt times as is very clear from the Text.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, The Lord ſaith, that <hi>Zion</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is his reſt, and dwelling place for ever, ſpeaking prophetically alſo by <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 132.13. and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>Cry out, and ſhout, thou inhabitant of Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for great is the holy one of Iſrael in the midſt of thee. Iſa.</hi> 12.6. A clear Propheſie of Chriſts Kingdome. Again,</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, That Chriſts Seat is to be in <hi>Zion</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is clear, for <hi>Micah</hi> propheſying of the laſt dayes, and of both the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of <hi>Iſraels</hi> return, <hi>(viz.) Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judahs</hi> return out of their laſt &amp; long captivity, ſaith, <hi>I will make of her that halteth a remnant, and her that mas caſt off a ſtrong nation, and the Lord ſhall raign o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them IN MO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NT ZION, henceforth even for ever, for the Lord hath appeared of old unto thee ſaying, I have loved thee with an everlaſting love, for there ſhall be a day that the watchmen upon the Mount</hi> Ephraim, <hi>ſhall cry, ariſe ye, and let us go up to ZION <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>N<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TO THE LORD O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R GOD. For there ſhall the glorious Lord be unto thee a place of broad rivers,</hi> for he <hi>ſhall roar out of Zion, and utter his voyce from Jeruſalem, for the LORD DWELETH IN ZION, Micah</hi> 4.2, 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.6. <hi>Amos</hi> 1.2. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31.4. Chap. 33.2. From theſe and many more Scriptures, and reaſons that might be given, we may ſee where Chriſts Throne ſhall be in the time of his Kingdome, which is, on Mount <hi>Zion</hi> in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that Throne which was his Father <hi>Davids,</hi> which he took from the <hi>Jebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites,</hi> and Chriſt will alſo take it from the Antichriſt, and will poſſeſs it for ever, that the everlaſting covenant may be made good in him, even the ſure mercies of <hi>David,</hi> not to want a man to ſit upon his <hi>Throne,</hi> but <hi>that</hi> of the fruit of his loynes according to the fleſh, he ſhould raiſe up Chriſt to ſit upon his Throne, and ſo ſhall the word of the Lord be fulfilled (in its time) which ſpeaks of Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome according to the very letter of the word, as it was fulfilled (in the letter of the word) about his ſufferings; and thus I paſs this
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:119763:55"/>
particular, and come to the ſixt and laſt, which is, how long Chriſt ſhall raign, and the eſtate of the wicked in that time.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, As it hath been already proved, that Chriſt and the Saints ſhal receive a kingdom, &amp; raign upon earth; now I ſhal proceed to reſolve the matter as touching the time, and that is alſo fore-told in the Scriptures to be a thouſand yeares, which time will contain ten generations, it being preconſidered, that perſons ſhall live (in that day) to be an hundred years old, according to the words of the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.20. which ſaith, <hi>There ſhall be no more thence, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant of dayes, nor an old man, that hath not filled his dayes, for the child ſhall die an hundred yeares old, and the ſinner being an hundred yeares old ſhall be accurſed;</hi> and that curſe ſhall be the ſame ſpoken by the Prophet, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.12. and that the time will be a thouſand years, is plain from the words of the Lord to <hi>John, Rev.</hi> 20.4, 5, 6, 7. where the Lord ſhewed <hi>John,</hi> that the godly were to live again after death, and to raign with Chriſt a thouſand yeares, before the reſt of the dead men (<hi>viz.</hi> the wicked) were to live again. But if it ſhould be demanded of me, whether Chriſt and the Saints, ſhall raign but one thouſand yeares, I ſhould not ſay poſſitively that they are to raign no longer, as juſt to limit the time; yet I ſhall give my judgment as (a man who have obtained favour of the Lord) and ſay, its like that a thouſand yeares may be the ſet time; firſt, becauſe we know that Chriſt is to give up the Mediator-ſhip, and kingdome into the hands of the Father, and then he is to be all in all, (as you may read, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24.) and the Son then muſt be in ſubjection to the Father; ſo that although Chriſt be to receive the Kindom, and greatneſs of the Kingdom under the whole heaven, and poſſeſs it, and raign, yet he is to leave it again at the time appointed of the Father, which ſeems to be the time before mentioned, <hi>(viz.)</hi> at the end of the thouſand yeares; but if it ſhould be objected and ſaid.</p>
                        <p>Object. <hi>That that thouſand years raign which you ſpeak of, may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be but the very time or day that Chriſt, and the Saints ſhall paſs ſentence upon the wicked, as Chriſt to judge, &amp; the righteous to be ſaid to judge, as they acknowledg Chriſts judgement to be juſt, &amp; ſo trample down the wicked, becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith, that one day with the Lord is as a thouſand yeares, and a thouſand yeares as one day,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.8.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> It cannot be ſo underſtood, becauſe Chriſt is to ſit upon the Throne of his father <hi>David,</hi> and to <hi>GOVERN IT;</hi> in which time <hi>his dominion ſhall be from Sea to Sea, and from the rivers unto the end of the world; they that dwell in the Wilderneſs ſhall bow to him,

his enemies ſhall lick the duſt; the Kings of Tarſhiſh, and of the Iſles ſhall bring preſents; the Kings of Sheba, and Seba, ſhall offer gifts, yea all Kings ſhall fall down before him, all nations ſhall ſerve him, his name ſhall be for ever,</hi> (Name, ſignifieth authority) <hi>his name ſhall be continued as long as the Sun, and the whole earth ſhall be filled with his glory, Amen,</hi> Pſal. 62.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

                        <p>Secondly, We underſtand the ſix dayes vocation (of Gods work) doth hold forth, and teach us, that the continuation of the World is to be for ſix thouſand years, it being conſidered that a day with the Lord, is as a thouſand years (only the dayes to be ſhortned for the elects ſake) and the ſeventh day which was Gods reſt from his labour (and the year of <hi>Jubilee</hi>) to be underſtood to figure out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, the ſeven thouſand years which is to be the time of Chriſts Kingdome, and the glorious reſt that we are to labour to enter in to.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, It appears to be a large time, becauſe the families of the earth are to come up to worſhip this great King, the Lord of Hoſts, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. <hi>Zach.</hi> 14. <hi>Mich.</hi> 4. and the Lord is to be their teacher, and he is to make war (at that time) to ceaſe to the ends of the earth, and he is to be one, and his name one at that time, and to govern the nation upon the earth; all which things beſpeaks more time than a moment, or one (natural) dayes time.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, It further appears that the time will not be ſhort, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the time of Chriſts Kingdome, his will ſhall be done in earth as it is done in heaven, when the Tabernacle of God ſhall be with men, and he dwell with them, as the time is at hand when it will be ſo, and the earth ſhall be full of the Knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the Sea; time would fail me to ſpeak of theſe things in particular, and therefore I ſhall omit it at preſent, and more eſpecially becauſe there are many in this nation would aſſiſt me with their help in this point of Chriſts Kingdom, if it ſhould lie at the ſtake,

for want of proof, and that makes me the more ſparing, for I could thorow Gods aſſiſtance ſpeak more largely, about the ſame point, but becauſe of the reaſons before mentioned, I have only given thee what lyeth before me in my underſtanding, and leave the moſt ſerious peruſal of things until a future and greater occaſion offereth it ſelf unto me, and at preſent ſhall only ſpeak a few words to the eſtate and condition of the wicked in the day of the Lord, and in the time of his Kingdome; which is,</p>
                        <p>Firſt, as concerning the coming of Chriſt, we find that the greateſt part of men ſhall be gathered together to make up that company of <hi>Gogg</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> and we may read what will become of them, when the Vine of the earth is reaped, and caſt into the great Winepreſs of God, and trod without the gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that blood ſhall come out to the horſe bridle, and <hi>Joel,</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeaks largly of that; and more of it, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19.1.

Chap. 16.16. <hi>ARMAGEDDON,</hi> a place of ſlaughter, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.17, 18, 19, 20. From theſe and many more which might be cited (the which elſewhere I have cited) we may ſee that a very great multitude will be ſlain at the very time when Chriſt ſhall take his Kingdome, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a few ſhall be affrighted and give glory to God: but the next, or that which remains, is, to ſpeak ſomewhat of the reſt which are not ſlain: and,</p>
                        <p>Firſt, we cannot conclude any of them in a ſtate of Salvation, or any grace to be offered to them that are wicked, and refuſe the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Goſpel, ſave them few above written; becauſe when Chriſt cometh, he that then is holy ſhall be holy ſtill, and he that then is filthy, ſhall then be filthy ſtill, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.11, 12.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the great Antichriſt ſhall cauſe all unleſs the ſanctifyed ones, and ſome few elect that ſhall eſcape him, to receive a mark in their right hand, or forehead, and they that eſcape the ſword which received his mark, they ſhall be tormented day and night, and they ſhall have ſuch curſes as I ſpake of not long before, concerning the ſinner that remained ſo till he come to be a ſinner an hundred years old: But paradventure ſome may ſay.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Ccording to my promiſe, and the deſire of many Friends, I have taken in hand to give ſome further Account of the Conference that we had at your Houſe, in <hi>June</hi> the 3d. 1658. Together with an Examination and Tryal of ſome few Particulars publiſhed by you upon a more mature conſideration; But truly I muſt be very brief, becauſe the Preſs hath waited a long while for it by reaſon of my being ſo much from home, and taken off upon other occaſions, for indeed part of my Book hath been print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long ſince, the which part was far briefer than it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended if time would have admitted; and alſo if the man to whom I had Dedicated it (in chief) had been in <hi>England,</hi> but he being far remote, and alſo giving forth ſpeeches, that he would not meddle any more with me, either in Diſputation, nor in the Preſs, I did only intend to anſwer that which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed moſt material (unto me) and to remove it from my door, and alſo to ſhew my opinion upon ſome other Subjects, which are material, and worth examination as at this day; at the end of which, I did promiſe to ſpeak ſomewhat in order to the reviving of our former Diſcourſe, upon which I did

alſo peruſe your Treatiſe, intituled, <hi>The Key of Scripture Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies; or, A Glaſs of ſome new Diſcoveries;</hi> to the end that I might the better know your Judgment; when I had ſeen it delivered (by you) upon deliberation, with ſerious and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thoughts; and when I had read it and peruſed it, I was very much aſtoniſhed at the conſideration thereof, to think how much I was bereaved of my underſtanding, if that Piece were worthy to be authorized by a man of your gravity and ingenuity; but however, I deſire not to be too confident, it may be of greater worth, than it appears to me to be, and therefore I ſhall reveiw ſome few particulars, and in the words of Sobriety and Humility give my judgment of things, as they appear to me, in the plainneſs and ſimplicity thereof, to the end, that I may inform thoſe who are out of the way, (and yet will ask and enquire for the good old way) and to leave others (who are wiſe in their own conceit) to ſtand and fall unto their own Maſter, without caſting dirt, or things of that nature upon them; the which I find to be moſt profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (in reference) to Godlineſs, although moſt unpleaſing unto the fleſh: But to wave theſe things, and all kind of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumlocution, my deſire is, that theſe Lines may not be miſ-repreſented upon your ſpirits, as though what I write here, be the venting of any thing from a private prejudice, but thoſe things that I rather aim at, is love and good will, firſt to your ſelves, and then to all thoſe that poſſibly may be miſ-led, and be in that <hi>Babel</hi> that you ſuppoſe others are in; therefore let the Scripture and ſound Reaſon guide you, (I mean Scripture Reaſon) and the Lord (if it be his will) give you a right underſtanding therein; which is the deſire of him which deſires your eternal peace; who is</p>

to know it; for if Chriſt have put an end to any of his Laws and Statutes, ſo as they are not to be practiſed in all Ages by the godly, then thoſe that do practiſe or ſet up any thing that Chriſt hath put an end to, are ſtrivers with their Maker, and fighters againſt Chriſt: Even ſo, whoſoever ſhall adventure to nulliſie or extenuate any of the Laws or Statutes of King Jeſus, which he hath appointed to be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed, and hath confirmed by Signs and Miracles, and with his own blood, and hath no where repealed them, nor ſhewed that they muſt ceaſe, and come to an end before his ſecond Coming; it had been good for that man if he had not been <hi>born,</hi> or that a <hi>milſtone</hi> had been tyed about his <hi>neck,</hi> and been caſt into the depth of the <hi>Sea,</hi> (in the day of his birth, rather then have ſo done, and to ſtand the hazard of the indignation of the great King at his appearance and Kingdome) if he with an high hand do perſiſt in it: Therefore dear friend, and Courteous Reader, take heed and try well what thou receiveth, and let not ſuppoſed conſequences, and mens opinions (upon ſentences of Scripture, which are doubtful and diſputable, which neither thou well underſtandeth, nor he that would expound them unto thee) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade thee to forſake or tranſgreſs againſt the known Laws of King Jeſus, which hath been confirmed, and no where repealed; and in thy ſo doing, namely, in thy keeping faithfully that which he hath left upon record (uncancelled) and committed unto thy truſt to keep, he alſo will keep thee in the great time of temptation and tryal, ſafe under the covert of his wings to everlaſting life and glory; which is the deſire of him,</p>

                     <hi>Ephraim,</hi> ſaid as touching his Idols, what have we to do with ſuch things any more for ever, and caſt them a way as filthy rags, and ever follow that which makes for peace, and the things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we may edifie one another, which is well pleaſing to God, and approved of by men: And now becauſe of time, I ſhall come to the point in controverſie; which is,</p>
                  <p>Whether all the Ordinances of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt be to be held up, and practiſed by the Lords people, in all ages to the worlds end, yea or nay?</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer, and ſay, That they are all to be upheld, contended for, and practiſed by the Lords People to the worlds end: and in order to the clearing of this point, and opening this diſcourſe of yours hinted at above, I ſhall lay down a poſition as a ground for the diſcourſe, and ſhall prove it by Scripture, and Scripture reaſons; and alſo in the examination of your words, I ſhall ſhew that you in effect confeſſe it, or at the leaſt to my under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, it appears ſo: but ſhal leave it to be judged of by the ſerious reader; together with my anſwer to your objections to that point; &amp; now the point that I ſhal lay down, as a ground of my diſcourſe; is,</p>
                  <p>That whatſoever Ordinances (or all the Ordinances) that Chriſt appointed in his laſt will and Teſtament, to be practiſed by his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and Churches in that age, is to continue, and to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by his Churches in all ages to the end of the world.

All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore,</hi> (and ſo forth.) From whence we may learn, that Chriſt did inform his Diſciples, that his command was ſufficient to authorize them, and all the godly after them, to go forth, and preach, and baptize, and gather, coſtitute (or ſtate) Churches (as you call it) to the worlds end; as if Chriſt ſhould have ſaid, you need not queſtion your authority, in your going forth, and doing what I command

you, for all power in heaven and earth is given unto me, therefore I have ſufficient authority to appoint you to the work, and my commandement and appointment is a ſufficient authority for you to do it, therefore go queſtioning nothing, for the Father hath made me the great Law-giver, and alſo given me power over all fleſh, that whoſoever obeyeth not my Laws, ſhall be cut off from among the people; therefore go, queſtion not, but make Diſciples, and Baptize them, (they muſt be firſt made Diſciples by preaching to them, and inſtructing them, and they being thus made Diſciples, baptize them;) and alſo there is a further thing to be taught them, for as you muſt teach them to believe in Chriſt, and repent of their former ſins be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ye baptize them; ſo their is a teaching (alſo) after baptizing; and that is, you muſt teach them to obſerve all the Ordinances, and Statutes that I have commanded you, that they may be followers of your ſteps, as you are followers of mine, that ſo it may appear their is but one Faith, one Baptiſme, one Lord, one Law-giver, one Hope of calling, that my ſtatutes may be unalterable till the worlds end; mind the weight of theſe wotds, <hi>Teach them to obſerve all things whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I have commanded you:</hi> So then whatſoever Ordinances, and Statutes Chriſt commanded the Apoſtles, and his Diſciples, which was the firſt Church; the very ſame muſt be taught, to the ſucceſſive Churches in all ages to the worlds end: the conſequence is clear, which is, that Chriſts Ordinances, and Statutes are to be taught, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, and practiſed after Chriſt and the Apoſtles by their ſucceſſors, in all ages till the worlds end. And this further appears, for as Chriſt promiſed them that in their ſo doing, that he would be with them to the end of the world; even ſo the holy Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, (as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that holy Ordinance of breaking of bread, and eating of it, and bleſſing of wine, and drinking of it, in commemoration of Chriſts death; that their doing of it, was to ſhew forth the Lords death, till he came again. To which I find theſe two objections, <hi>(viz.)</hi> as firſt to that in, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. <hi>Loe, I am with you always, to the end of the world.</hi> That is ſaith <hi>Mr. Henden,</hi> to the end of that age: and this he ſaid to me in that diſcourſe above mentioned, to which I ſay now as I ſaid then to him; It ſeems very ſtrange to me, that a man that profeſſeth Schollar-ſhip, and godlineſs ſhould ſay ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhame, and bluſhing; for confident I am, that if <hi>Mr. Henden</hi> knoweth any thing, he knoweth this, that although the word, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, may be taken for age, yet it is to be underſtood the end of age, or the whole time at leaſt of Chriſts aſcention, till his coming to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:119763:62"/>
for if it were to be underſtood only, that age or generation (then in being) then the word would have been rendred thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> which is a word uſed by the ſame Evangeliſt for generation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.34. and it is frequently uſed for the preſent age or generation; but a few words to obſerve the ſequal or obſurdities of the conſequence: which is,</p>
                  <p>By Mr. <hi>Hendens</hi> opinion, preaching and baptizing, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Chriſts preſence with his people, was to continue no longer than that preſent age, that the Apoſtles lived in; for preaching and baptizing, and the promiſe of Chriſts preſence, is the things that Chriſt ſpeaks of, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20, 21. And that is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, but to continue but for that preſent age, ſaith Mr. <hi>Henden;</hi> and yet he ſaith, (in the ſecond page of his book, intituled, <hi>A glaſs of ſome new diſcoveries</hi>) <hi>That the Miniſtry, and Baptiſme, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, was to remain, and did not fall in all the times of Apoſtaſie.</hi> And how theſe things agree together, or whether they come not from a <hi>Babel</hi> underſtanding, I ſhall leave the ſerious reader to Judge, and paſs to the next Objection; which is, in anſwer to Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> words to the <hi>Corinths,</hi> 1 Epiſtle 11. Chap. which ſaith, <hi>So often as you eat of that bread, and drink of that cup, ſhew ye the Lords death till he comes.</hi> But ſay ſome, (here I do not accuſe Mr. <hi>Henden</hi>) but rather the generation of men commonly called <hi>Quakers</hi>) affirming that Chriſt is already come, meaning that he is come in ſpirit, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the hearts of the Godly. To which I anſwer and ſay, that they which had obtained that injoyment (even the Church of <hi>Theſſaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> which was in God) even they did expect that perſonal coming of the ſame Jeſus that was crucified, and raiſed again form the dead, which delivered us from the wrath to come: and that the Church of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> was a Chruch in God, read 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.1, 8. And that the word of the Lord ſounded out from them, read <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. and yet for all that they waited for Chriſts appearance, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. chap. 2.19. chap. 3.13. chap. 4.15, 16, 17, 18. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7. many places of holy Scripture might be brought to prove this, but time is pretious, and alſo becauſe this Church is a people much ſpoken of by them: I only bring this Epiſtle, although I could bring <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> to prove this at large: but I leave this objection, and the former, and ſhall ſhew you ſeveral grounds and reaſons, why all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Chriſt ſhall continue practicable, and to be practiſed by the Lords people till his ſecond coming.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. The firſt ground and reaſon is, becauſe the Commiſſion doth
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:119763:62"/>
not only direct &amp; command the Apoſtles &amp; Miniſtry to teach men to obſerve all things, <hi>(viz.)</hi> all Chriſts Statutes, and Ordinances: but alſo commands, that it ſhould be made known to all the World ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively, that every creature may hear of it, for the obedience of faith; and he that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18, 19, 20. In ſhort, I ſhall obſerve only theſe three things; which is,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, that it was the will of Chriſt that the Apoſtles ſhould teach the obſervation of <hi>ALL HIS STAT<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>TES.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, as it was his will to have the obſervation of all his Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes taught, ſo alſo it was his will, that the obſervation of all his Statutes ſhould be taught to all men, namely, all Nations, or every creature, (that is) where ever the ſound of the Goſpel went (which hath or ſhall be preached to all nations for a witneſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.14. <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.6.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it was alſo his will, that all men might know, that in their obſerving all his Statutes and Ordinances unto the end, that they ſhould not only obtain ſalvation at the laſt, but in the mean time in the obſervation of his Statutes and Ordinances, they ſhould have his ſpiritual preſence with them alwayes to the end of the World; that is, he would as well manifeſt his ſpiritual preſence with the ſucceſſive generations to the end of age, as to the age or generation then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But ſome will ſay, that <hi>God doth not manifeſt himſelf in our age as he did in the primitive age, for they could work mircales, &amp; ſo cannot we.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I briefly ſay (at preſent, becauſe I do intend to ſpeak more largely to it anon) that God hath manifeſted himſelf very gloriouſly to many, that never wrought any miracle, as I think none wil deny; for <hi>John</hi> did no miriacle, and yet God did manifeſt himſelf very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently to him; but more of that anon, and at preſent I paſs to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ground &amp; reaſon, to prove, that all the Ordinances that Chriſt appointed in his laſt will and teſtament, are to continue till his ſecond coming.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Becauſe when Chriſt aſcended up on high, (as he left his mind and will what he would have done, even ſo <hi>he gave gifts to men, ſome to be Apoſtles,</hi> (viz.) <hi>Meſſengers</hi>) <hi>and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors, and Teachers, for the gathering (or perfecting) of the Saints for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the body of Chriſt, till we all come into the unity of the faith, and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:119763:63"/>
of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto the perfect man; unto the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the ſtature of Chriſt: that we HENCEFORTH</hi> (mark that) <hi>be no more children toſſed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the ſlights of men, &amp; cunning craftineſs, whereby they lie in wait to deceive.</hi> From this text we may learn, that it was the wiſdome of Chriſt, in order to accompliſh his laſt will and teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he did give gifts to men, that they might be enabled in their ſucceſſive generations to preach, exhort, reprove, and correct, to the end, that the man of God, or ſervants of God, namely, the Church of God, might be furniſhed with every good work; that henceforth, (that is from that time forward) they might not be toſſed (that is removed) from that doctrine which Chriſt left in command, in his laſt will and teſtament, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.10, 11, 12, 13, 14. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.14, 15, 16. The conſequence is, that what Chriſt appointed in his laſt will and teſtament, was perpetuated, and to remain from that time and forward, until all the Saints came to the unity of the faith, and that perfect man, even to the ſtature and fulneſs of Chriſt: and ſo I paſs to the third ground and reaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. It further appears, that whatſoever Chriſt appointed to be practiſed, in his laſt Will and Teſtament, is perpetuated, and to remain becauſe it was before declared, by God to <hi>Moſes</hi> (and good reaſon there was) that the Laws and Statutes of Chriſt, ſhould be perpetuated, and remain as well as <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, which did remain untill a more glorious adminiſtration; for when <hi>Moſes</hi> was dead, yet his Law ſpake which ſhewed him to be a Law-giver of ſome authority; but if it were as ſome would have it, Chriſts Law muſt needs be ſo weak, as to die with him, or a non after him, or at leaſt ſome of them, and ſo in effect ſay, that Chriſt is a more weaker or an imperfecter law-giver than <hi>Moſes:</hi> but that it was foretold by God, and given in charge, that all Chriſts Laws and Statutes, ſhould remain in all Generations, for all men to practiſe, according to their ſeveral abilities or meaſures, read <hi>Peters</hi> words, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22, 23. which ſaith, <hi>For</hi> Moſes <hi>truly ſaid unto the fathers, A Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up to you of your brethren, like unto me, him ſhall you hear in all things whatſoever he ſhall ſay unto you. And it ſhall come to paſſe, that every Soul that will not heare that Prophet, ſhall be deſtroyed from among the people.</hi> That which is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from this text, is firſt, that Chriſt muſt be heard in every thing, whatſoever he ſaith: and ſecondly, as he muſt be heard in every thing, in whatſoever he ſaith, even ſo he muſt be heard in every
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:119763:63"/>
thing by every ſoul: and thirdly, that it is ſo, is clear, becauſe who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever doth not heare (<hi>viz.</hi> obey) ſhall be deſtroyed; ſo then its plain, that all the Statutes and Ordinances, of the laſt will and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ought to be believed and practiſed by all thoſe that are the Lords people in all ages; and ſo I paſs to the fourth ground and reaſon, to prove the continuation of all the Statutes and Laws of Kings Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. Becauſe there muſt be no adding, nor deminiſhing from his words, no putting to nor taking from them, for it is a very great evil to put in or take out of it; if it be but a mans will, and Teſtament, as ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 3.15. in theſe words, <hi>Brethren, I ſpeak after the manner of men, though it be but a mans Covenant, or Teſtament, yet if it be confirmed, no man diſanulleth or addeth there unto. For as ſaith the Lord</hi> (Rev. 22.18.) <hi>I teſtifie to every one that heareth the words of the Propheſie, of this booke, if any man ſhall adde unto theſe things, God ſhall add unto him the plagues that are written in this booke. And if any man ſhall take away from the words of this booke, God ſhall take away his part out of the booke of life, and the holy City, and from the things that are written in this booke.</hi> For as he is an unalterable Prieſt, and hath an unchangeable Preiſt-hood, even ſo he is an unalterable King, and Prophet, and hath unalterable or unchangeable Lawes, Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and Statutes, and happy are all thoſe that obſerve, and keep them unto the end. And to this end the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who was faithful to Chriſt, who did not hide or ſhun to declare the whole counſel of God, did direct the ſucceſſive Miniſters, as <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> what to do after him, both in reſpect of Doctrine, and diſcipline, and ſheweth them how they ſhould behave themſelves in the Church of Chriſt, and alſo to commit it to faithful men, that might teach others after them, and what quallifications ought to be found in Biſhops, and Deacons, namely Paſtors, and ſuch as were to take care of the poor; ſo that it is very evident, that it was the care of the Apoſtle, to leave in charge an orderly proviſion for both ſouls and bodies, of the Churches of Chriſt, as Paſtors or Biſhops, to take care of their ſouls, and Deacons to take care of their bodies, and the externall way of eſtabliſhing them or appointing them to the work, was by faſting, and prayer, with laying on of Hands, as he himſelf, and the reſt of the Miniſtry were eſtabliſhed, as <hi>Acts</hi> 13.3. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5, 6, 7, 8. more there might be added, but at preſent I ſhall only add a few ſentences,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:119763:64"/>
of Scriptures, but not any of them texts laſt cited, but others; as firſt, the charge that <hi>Paul</hi> giveth to the Paſtors, or Elders of the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> at his departure, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. in theſe words, <hi>Take heed unto your ſelves and unto all the flock, over which the holy Ghoſt hath made you overſeers, to feed the Church of God, which he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with his own blood. For I know this, that after my departure, ſhall grievous wolves enter in among you, not ſparing the flock.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith he to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. in theſe words, <hi>I charge</hi> thee <hi>therefore before God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall judge the quicke and the dead at his appearance, and Kingdome. Preach the word, inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon; reprove, rebuke, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort with all long-ſuffering and doctrine. Watch thou in all things, indure affliction, do the work of an Evangeliſt, make a full proof of thy Miniſtry; for their are many unruly and vain talkers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore rebuke them ſharply, that they may be found in the faith: but a man that is an Hereticke, after the firſt and ſecond admonition, reject. And the things that thou haſt heard, and ſeen in me, the ſame commit to faithful men, who alſo may teach others.</hi> Tit. 1.10. Chap. 3.10. 2 Tim. 2.2. So then thoſe Laws that Chriſt appointed his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to walk in, they muſt teach there ſucceſſors to walk in, and their ſucceſſors muſt commit it to others, that they might teach the Generation to come, to that end, that Chriſts Laws, Statutes, &amp; Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, might be as unchangeable as his Preiſt-hood; and ſo the words of the author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> may be verified, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8. Which ſaith, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever. Be not carried about with divers and ſtrange doctrines:</hi> but do all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the pattern, which the Lord Jeſus hath ſhewed us in his laſt Will and Teſtament, <hi>and as many as walk according to this rule,</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> in another caſe ſaith) <hi>peace be upon them, and mercy upon all ſuch Iſraelites of God:</hi> and thus I paſſe to the fifth ground and reaſon, to prove, that all the Laws, Statues, and Ordinances appointed by Chriſt in his laſt Will and Teſtament, are to remain practicable, and to be practiſed by the Lords people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. It further appears, that all the Statutes, and Ordinances of Chriſt, are to be practiſed by the Lords people till his ſecond coming; becauſe when the Apoſtle <hi>Jude,</hi> ſpeaks (by the holy ſpirit) of ſome that would be as wandring ſtars, which had turned from the ſimplicity of the Goſpel; he exhorts the Saints, earneſtly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for the faith, once delivered unto the Saints, <hi>Jude</hi> 3. which agrees well with that prophetical ſaying of the wiſe man, <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons

If thou know not (O thou faireſt among women) go thy way forth by the footſteps of the flocke, and ſeed thy kidds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the ſhepheards tents.</hi> The which both places ſheweth plainly, that the people in after ages, ſhould walk in the ſame footſteps, and by the ſame rule that the primitive Church walked in, for that text is a propheſie of theſe times, or that which very much concerns theſe times, as we may ſee from <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. in theſe words, <hi>My beloved is like a Roe, or a young Hart: he ſtandeth behind our wall, he locketh forth at the window, ſhewing himſelf thorow the latteſſe. My beloved ſpake, and ſaid unto me, Riſe up my fair one and come away, for loe the winter is paſt,</hi> (mark that) <hi>the raine is over and gone. The flowers appear on the earth, the time of the ſinging</hi> of birds <hi>is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land.

Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that ſpoile our vines: for our vines</hi> have <hi>tender grapes.</hi> From this text we may learn or obſerve theſe things; firſt, that Chriſt doth manifeſt or ſhew himſelf to his People now, although not ſo viſibly to be beheld or tooke notice of by others, no but as it were out of a window, or thorow a latteſſe: ſecondly, that it is a propheſie that concerns us, is clear from theſe words; <hi>for loe the winter is paſt,</hi> meaning the ſharp perſecutions of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Whore, which hath made all Nations drunk with the wine of fornication, and the Kings thereof to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit fornication with her, and ſo they by her appointment have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted the Saints, in their ſeverall dominions, and ſo have cauſed the people of God to creep as it were into the clefts of the rocks, out of the which they are to come forth; and the next and laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of the Devil is to transform himſelf like unto a Angel of Light, and ſo ſhall deſtroy more by ſubtilty then by violence, and that is his deſign in the laſt daies, as Chriſt and his Apoſtles have foretold at large, the which we ſee to be accompliſhing a great pace, in our Nation, which ſheweth, that theſe are the laſt dayes; and alſo this text ſpeaking to the ſame thing, ſaying, <hi>Take us thoſe foxes, thoſe little foxes, that ſpoile our vines: for our vines have tender grapes.</hi>

Which is to be underſtood, that when the Church is young, and newly come forth out of thoſe troubleſome times, that many ſhall be ſpoiled by the ſubtilty of the Devil, putting it into the hearts of the ſons of men, to pervert the Scriptures, and turn men away from the good ancient paths of Chriſt, which makes the Spouſe inquire in the midſt of theſe varieties of opinions, where Chriſt would have his Flock to reſt; and his anſwer is, that they muſt <hi>Goe by the footſteps of the flocke;</hi> that is, in the very ſteps, or way that Chriſts flock of old walked in, and contend for that faith, and hold faſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of that faith, without wavering, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt is the ſame, yeſterday, to day, and for ever; and thus it appears, that all the Laws, Statutes, and Ordinances, which are comprehended in the laſt Will and Teſtament of the Lord Jeſus, are practicable, and are to be practiſed by the Lords people: and thus I paſſe to the ſixth ground, and reaſon, to prove, that al Chriſts Statutes and Ordinances, as before mentioned, are perpetuated, and to remain till the Lords ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

Set the tranſgreſſors under <hi>Moſes</hi> law, as an example to thoſe that deſpiſe or obſerve not Chriſts laws; and if all Chriſts Laws, Statutes, and Ordinances, (which are written in the new Teſtament and confirmed) are not as perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual as <hi>Moſes</hi> law, then it cannot be a more greater tranſgreſſion, and a more ſore puniſhment to diſobey them; for <hi>Moſes</hi> laws was perpetuated with a, <hi>curſed is he, that continueth not in all things, that is written in the book of the law, to do them, and all the people ſhall ſay, Amen;</hi> but Chriſts Laws which are written, (for many of them) were not perpetuated but loſt their authority and dyed with that age, or generation (as ſaith Mr. <hi>Henden</hi>) and ſome are ſo bold as to ſay, that not only ſome, but all the Statutes &amp; Ordinances of Chriſt, which are written in the new Teſtament, were only theirs, or belonging to them in that age, and not to us; and in my underſtanding, one ſpeaks as true as the other, for he that ſaith ſome of the Laws and Statutes of Chriſt are to ceaſe, and yet cannot prove that the will of Chriſt is cancelled, nor ſhew where Chriſt or his Apoſtles, have ſaid, that theſe Statutes and Ordinances, muſt ceaſe at ſuch a time; were as good ſay, all muſt ceaſe; one having as good a warrant for what he ſaith, as the other. But paſſing this, all that was written in <hi>Moſes</hi> laws was to be obſerved, &amp; kept as wel when they had loſt that gift of <hi>

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:119763:65"/>
For we find that the book of the law was to be read, and the People to obſerve and do it, according as it was written therein; and we find that good <hi>Joſiah,</hi> when the book of the law was found, after it had been loſt, rent his cloathes when he heard it read, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration how far the people were revolted from it, and gave com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to the people to reform, and obſerve to do the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the Lord, as it was found written in the book of the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and as it was given in commandement, to all the godly, or all the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to obſerve, and keep the commandement as it was writeen; even ſo, all that were godly amongſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> did accordingly obſerve and keep them, untill <hi>Shilo</hi> (or the great law-giver) came (even Jeſus Chriſt) and in like manner as Jeſus Chriſt did command his Laws and Statutes, to be tought to every creature, and to be obſerved by all the faithful, even ſo the faithful, have, and will in every age faithfully keep them; and that Chriſts Laws are ſet in opoſition to <hi>Moſes</hi> Laws, (that is to ſay, they are as weighty, and as perpetual as <hi>Moſes</hi> were) is proved, and it is alſo evident, that they were to remain, as well when they came out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> as before they went into <hi>Babylon, Nehem.</hi> 8.1, 2, 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3, 4. and ſo I paſs to the ſeventh ground and reaſon, to prove, that all the Laws, Statutes and Ordinances, appointed by Chriſt in the new Teſtament, (which is his laſt will, are to remain) to be practiſed by the Lords people, untill his ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

It further appears, that Chriſts Laws are perpetuated, and to remain as aforeſaid; becauſe if it be but a mans Teſtament, yet if it be confirmed, no man muſt diſanul, nor add thereunto, as ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 3 15. but this is not only the will and Teſtament of him who hath an unchangeable Preiſt-hood, and liveth for ever, but alſo it is confirmed, not by the blood of bulls and goates, but by his own blood; and therefore no man may diſanul, or add there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, without being in danger of everlaſting wrath, and cuting off from amonſt the people; and that Chriſts will and Teſtament, was confirmed both by his blood, and with ſigns and miracles, read theſe few cited texts in the room of many that might be cited; ſee <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. In theſe words, <hi>For if the blood of buls and of goats, and the aſhes of an heifer ſprinkling the unclean, ſanctifieth to the purifying of the fleſh. How much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the eternal Spirit, offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without ſpot to God? purge your conſcience from dead works, to ſerve
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:119763:66"/>
the living God: And for this cauſe he is the Mediatour of the new Teſtament, that by means of death, for the redemption of the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that were under the firſt Teſtament, they which are called, might receive the promiſe of eternal inheritance. For where a Teſtament is, there muſt alſo of neceſſity be the death of the Teſtator. For a Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is of force after men are dead: otherwiſe it is of no ſtrength at all, while the Teſtator liveth. Whereupon, neither the firſt</hi> Teſtament <hi>was dedicated without blood. For when</hi> Moſes <hi>had ſpoken every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept unto the people, according to the Law, he took the blood of calves and of goats;</hi> (and ſo forth) <hi>Saying, This is the blood of the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which God hath enjoyned unto you. It was therefore neceſſary that the patterns of things in the heavens ſhould be purified with theſe, but the heavenly things themſelves with better ſacrifices than theſe.</hi> From this text compared with <hi>chap.</hi> 2. and <hi>verſ.</hi> 3, 4. with <hi>Mark</hi> 16.20. we may learn, that the new Teſtament is confirmed both with ſigns, and miracles, and divers gifts of the holy Ghoſt, and alſo with Chriſts blood, for the Teſtator did die, and is alive, and therefore unleſs one greater than Jeſus Chriſt or himſelf, do cancel that will and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; woe, woe, woe, be to that man or woman, that diſanulleth any one of Chriſts Laws and Statutes, they (at the laſt) will be found to be tranſgreſſors, and guilty of all; for ſo it was in <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, all things muſt be done according to the pattern as it was written, and even ſo ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Teach them</hi> (after you) <hi>to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you;</hi> And the very ſame (as hath been ſaid already) was given in charge by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to the Miniſtry after him, as <hi>Acts</hi> 20 35. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Thoſe things that ye have both learned, and received, and heard, and ſeen in me, do: and the God of peace ſhall be with you.</hi> And thus I paſs to the eighth ground and reaſon, to prove, that all the Laws and Statutes of Chriſt, given forth in his laſt will and Teſtament, are to remain, and be practiſed by the Lords people.</p>

And now for men to bring a Goſpel (as they pretend) without ſome of theſe Ordinances, and to nullifie others, and extenuate the ſtrength of many, is to bring ſuch a Goſpel, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> never brought, but it is another Goſpel, and ſuch are to be rejected by the ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt: admit of this ſhort argument; which is,</p>
                  <p>If the Goſpel which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> brought and preached, was a Goſpel containing all the Laws, Statutes and Ordinances of King Jeſus; then thoſe that bring a Goſpel, with many of them left out, bring not the ſame but another Goſpel and is to be rejected.</p>
                  <p>But the Goſpel that <hi>Paul</hi> brought, was a Goſpel containing all the Laws, Statutes and Ordinances of King Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>Therefore he that brings or preacheth, a Goſpel with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay of them left out, bringeth another Goſpel, and is to be rejected. Read the words of <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 1.6, 7, 8. which ſaith, <hi>I marvail, that you are ſo ſoon removed from him that called you into the grace of Chriſt, unto another Goſpel: Which is not another: but there be ſome that trouble you, and would pervert the Goſpel of Chriſt. But though we, or an Angel from heaven, preach</hi> any other Goſpel <hi>unto you, then that which we have alreardy preached unto you, let him be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed. As we ſaid before, ſo ſay I now again, If any man preach any other Goſpel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accurſed.</hi> From which words we plainly ſee, it is of a very dangerous conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, for any man to bring any other Goſpel, ſave the very ſame, which was preached by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Apoſtles; and that Goſpel, was a Goſpel containing all the Laws, Statutes and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of King Jeſus; as hath been already proved: therefore let every man take heed of perverting the Goſpel, either by adding or detracting, or wreſting any part thereof, to their vain corrupt ends: and ſo I paſs to the ninth ground or reaſon of the point, ſaying, If it ſhould be objected, that this text ſpeaks of ſome that would have brought the believers back again, to be juſtified by the law.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer breefly, and ſay, that let it be what particular it will, this we learn in general, that the very ſame Goſpel, with the very ſame Laws, Statutes and Ordinances which Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and the reſt of the Apoſtles preached and practiſed, is the very ſame that we muſt preach, and practiſe, or elſe be accurſed,</p>

It further appears, that all Chriſt Laws, Statutes and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances are perpetuated, and to remain; becauſe when Chriſt left the world, he put his houſe in order, and appointed to every man his work, <hi>Mark</hi> 13.34. and <hi>bleſſed is that ſervant that when his Lord comes, he finds ſo doing;</hi> as he left him in chrage: and thus Chriſt goeth before leading his people an example, and they follow his ſteps, and at laſt receive that bleſſed ſentence. <hi>Theſe are virgins, theſe are they that followed the Lamb, whitherſoever he goeth, here are they that keep the commandements of God, and the faith of Jeſus, right bleſſed are ſuch dead, that dye in the Lord; for they reſt from their labour, and their works follow them.</hi> And again, they only are Chriſts friends, that do whatſoever he commandeth, <hi>ſuch ſhall never be put to ſhame, that have a reſpect to all his commands;</hi> and again, bleſſed and thrice happy are they, that do all his commandements, they ſhall have right to the tree of life; and enter in thorow the gates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City, Amen.</p>

This tenth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why all Chriſts Ordinances, are to continue practicabe, and to be practiſed by the Lords people, is; becauſe as devils, and men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cancel or diſanul any one of them, neither hath Chriſt, either cancelled his will, or diſanulled any of his Laws, Statutes or Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; therefore they are perpetuated, and to remain practicable, and to be practiſed by the Lords people in all ages, according to their ſeveral abilities, untill the ſecond, and glorious coming of Jeſus Chriſt: and thus being in much haſt, I leave theſe few grounds and reaſons, to prove, the continuance of all Chriſts Ordinances practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to be practiſed by the Lords People in all ages, according
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:119763:67"/>
to their ſeveral abilities; and in the next place I come to the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the grounds and reaſons, which are cited by <hi>Mr. Henden,</hi> to prove, That ſome of Chriſts Laws and Statutes were to ceaſe, and are ceaſed, and ſhall leave the ſerious reader to judge, when I have impartially offered them to thy view without any leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the ſtrength of any one of them; for although I am necceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to gather up the ſtrength of his reaſon in as few words as may be, yet I will not (willingly) miſs any one thing, that is material or hath weight in it (cited by him) to prove the ceſſation of Chriſts Ordinances, and withal ſhall endeavour as much plainneſs of ſpeech, as that the weakeſt capacity (of them that are Godly) may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it when they read it, (that I may not be as a Barbarion unto them) the which I find to be the way moſt profitable unto Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, I ſhall begin with the firſt thing conſiderable, (which is) that which he calls, or lays down as a ſure Maxim, <hi>page</hi> 2. which is, ſaith he;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Every thing hath its beginning and continuance from the word of God; now whatſoever in Goſpel times is fore declared, and promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scripture for abiding, did not fall but was upheld by the power of the Word, thorow all the times of Apoſtacy, as the Ordinance of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, Prayer, Praiſes, Baptiſme, and the Communion,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.16, 17, 18. Rev. 9.13. Chap. 11.1. Heb. 13.15. Iſa. 55.13. Chap. 65.5. Mat. 28.19, 20. 1 Cor. 11.26. and alſo <hi>a ſealed elect number, with the ſpiritual union,</hi> Rev. 7.4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Chap. 9.4.

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For proof whereof,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> The ceſſation of theſe laſt mentioned Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances) <hi>we will begin with</hi> Iſa. 56.5. <hi>Even unto them,</hi> (<hi>viz</hi> the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch</hi>) <hi>will I give in my houſe, and within my walles, a place and a name, better then of that of ſons and of daughters: I will give them an everlaſting name that ſhall not be cut off.

Why ſhould not the place be ſaid to be everlaſting, as well as the name, eſpecially being before both joyned together, if the ſpirit had not ſeen the fail, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption of the change thereof?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> In order to the clear anſwer of theſe things, I ſhall branch them out in particulars; as firſt, <hi>Mr. Henden</hi> ſaith, <hi>Every thing hath its beginning, and continuance from the Word of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is very true, hence we conclude that God having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in his Word, that we ſhould hear his Son in every thing, whatſoever he ſhall ſay unto us, and that the Son alſo hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Apoſtles to teach others to do every thing, which he had commanded them to do: which was the obſervation of all his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, alwaies even to the end of the world; <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. which ſheweth, (for what I can (yet) ſee from your fore cited text, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.5.) that all Chriſts Ordinances are perpetuated, and to remain.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, you ſay, (and cite many texts to prove it) that <hi>the Miniſtry, Prayer, Praiſes, Baptiſme, and the Communion was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held, and did not fall in the greateſt to Apoſtaſie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My anſwer (in breif) to it is this. That if the fore mentioned Ordinances were upheld by the power of Gods Word, in the greateſt times of Apoſtaſie practicable, &amp; to be practiſed (as a duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to the Godly) then (ſee your ſelf that) you condemn your ſelf in the thing that you alow; for you do alow and believe (as you ſay) that Baptiſme and the Lords Supper was upheld by the power of Gods Word, and did not ceaſe, but was practicable, and tole practiſed by the Lords People thorowout all the times of Apoſtacy, as in <hi>page</hi> 2. <hi>line</hi> the 25. compared <hi>page</hi> 17. Paragraph the firſt, and if ſo, then you are to be condemned out of your own mouth; for (to my beſt underſtanding of your practiſe) you neither baptize and, nor practiſe that Ordinance of the Lords Supper, and then it's to marvel if that God hath given you over to blindneſs of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and mind; for it is juſt with God both to give an inlargement of underſtanding, to him that faithfully practiſeth, that which he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and alſo to take away the Talent from him that improveth it not, and give him up to blindneſs of mind; be wiſe to conſider be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the decree paſs, and there be no remedy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:119763:68"/>Thirdly, The third particular is, That the Ordinance of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with Church Cenſures, and the like, are ceaſed: Your firſt cited Text is, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.5. in theſe words, <hi>Even to them will I give in my Houſe, and within my walls, a place and name, better than that of Sons and of Daughters; I will give unto them an everlaſting Name that ſhall not be cut off. The Place,</hi> (ſay you) <hi>is to be underſtood (by interpretation from the Hebrew word, J A D, a Hard, allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Church power: and why ſhould not the word, Place within my Houſe, be everlaſting, as well as the Name; eſpecially they being both joyned together, if the Spirit had not ſeen the fail and interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the change thereof?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> If this Text ſay, that ſome of Chriſts Ordinances, (as Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, or Church Cenſures, or the like) are to ceaſe, I have (wholly) loſt my underſtanding in the Scriptures; but yet give me leave to ſhew my opinion, and then judge of it, as the Lord ſhall guid your underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>There is theſe two things in chief, that Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> gathereth from this Text; the one is, that it is a Propheſie of the primitive Goſpel Church, containing the Gentiles which at that time ſhould turn un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, That the place within his Houſe, is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood a HAND, alluding to Church power, <hi>viz.</hi> outward Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, as Ordination of Miniſtry, and Government, and Church Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and the like,</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer and ſay, though it will be proved to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of the primitive Goſpel Church. I have not yet ſeen by what Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> hath ſaid, that there was Gentiles and Eunuchs proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyted and joyned unto the Lord under the Law, is plain; and that they were to keep the Sabbath from polluting, is alſo as plain; and that they ſhould have a place, and a name in Gods Houſe, by laying hold of the Covenant, is plain; hence the <hi>Eunuch</hi> came from a far Country to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to Worſhip, (who was after converted by <hi>Philip</hi>) and this Text ſpeaks in order both to provoke the Jews to be zealous, to obſerve the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and alſo to encourage the Gentiles, (who were made Proſelytes) in their ſo doing, that they ſhould have a Place, and a Name in his Houſe, as well as others, (e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Jews) and that it ſpeaks of that juncture of time, and of thoſe Ordinances under the Law, (and not of Goſpel Ordinances) read <hi>verſ</hi> 7. where he ſaith, that <hi>their burnt Offerings, and their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices ſhould be acceptable upon his Altar;</hi> the which if I well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:119763:69"/>
it relates to the Ordinances under the Law, which were to be obſerved by the proſelyted Gentiles, as well as the Jews, and not at all to Goſpel Ordinances; (mark) I do not deny but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> doth propheſie of the converſion of the Gentiles to Goſpel Ordinances, as in <hi>Chap.</hi> 42.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. and in many other places, but not at all in that place: And as for the word, <hi>My ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is near;</hi> it may be underſtood, their being ſaved from the hands of their enemies; or many other wayes; (and not of Goſpel Ordinances) which the word Salvation will bear: And the word, <hi>I will gather others unto him,</hi> (which you ſeem to queſtion) is ſhewn to be the Houſe of Iſrael, as well as the Houſe of Judah; to wit, the diſperſed of <hi>Samaria;</hi> and that this ſpeaks of the other Houſe, (as Judah and Iſrael are diſtinguiſhed into two Houſes) namely, the Houſe of Iſrael, read <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. and peruſe it well, and conſider the two Sticks that are to become one in the Prophets hand, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare theſe together, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22. and you may find what is meant by the word, <hi>I will gather others unto him:</hi> But I paſs this for brevity ſake, and come to the fourth and laſt Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, as an anſwer to the above-mentioned Maxime; which is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Name and Place,</hi> (which ſaith Mr. <hi>Henden</hi>) <hi>are joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Text, and yet one perpetuated,</hi> (viz. <hi>the Name</hi>) <hi>and the other to ceaſe,</hi> (viz. <hi>the Place; which by interpretation is a Hand, alluding to Church Power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer and ſay, That although this Text cannot be proved a propheſie of the primitive Goſpel Church, as before ſaid; yet I ſhall ſpeak to this to leave it without a cover: And whereas Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> ſaith, that the <hi>Hebrew Word, J A D,</hi> ſignifying a Hand, alluding to Church Power; it is known, that the variety of acceptations both in the Hebrew and the Greek, are ſo great and many, that if men be of a corrupt opinion, they may wreſt and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the mind of the holy Spirit: I could inſtance ſome places accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſmall knowledge that I have in it, but I ſuppoſe the Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will not be denied by you; take heed of making the Scripture a noſe of Wax, to turn (both) this way and that way, or as men pleaſe: bear with my expreſſion and caution without offence: but admit it were as you ſay, (which it is not ſo) that is to ſay) what if that ſhould be (as it is not) a propheſie of the primitive Goſpel Church, and that alſo the word <hi>PLACE</hi> ſhould ſignifie <hi>Hand,</hi> allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Church Power; Doth that Text imply, that the word <hi>Place</hi> is not perpetual or everlaſting, as well as the Name; I am ſure that

the Text doth not ſay, that the Place, (<hi>viz.</hi> Hand as you call it) is not perpetual or everlaſting, as well as the Name; but if it be as you ſay, (that is,) that by <hi>PLACE,</hi> is to be underſtood a <hi>Hand,</hi> allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Church power, then I will take your own argument and diſprove you; that is, if I can prove the <hi>PLACE</hi> perpetuated and to remain, as well as the <hi>Name,</hi> then all that you have ſaid (here) falls to the ground without remedy; and that they are to remain in the <hi>PLACE,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Hand</hi> which is the Church power as you ſay) ſee the words of the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> which is a propheſie of that Houſe, and Place, and Name, which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks of, that the Gentiles (as well as the Jews) ſhould have the priviledge to have a Place therein, before ever the Place, or Walls, or Houſe was built; read 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.10. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.2. in theſe words, <hi>Moreover I will appoint a PLACE for my people Iſrael, and will plant them that they may dwell in a PLACE of their own, and move NO MORE.</hi> And that this Text holds correſpendency with the fore-ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Text, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56. ſee <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. compared with <hi>verſ.</hi> 8. <hi>Chap.</hi> 57.13. which alſo agreeth with the words of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.35, 36. which ſaith, <hi>For God will ſave Zion, and build the Cities of Judah, that they may dwell there and have it in poſſeſſion; the ſeed alſo of his ſervants ſhall inherit it, and they that love his Name, ſhall dwell therein;</hi> according to that Text, <hi>Revel</hi> 3.12. which ſaith, that they <hi>ſhall go no more out, but I will write upon him the Name of my God,</hi> &amp;c. and that is a better Name than of Sons and of Daughters; So then the Place is as laſting as the Name: But give me leave to ſpeak (a little like your ſelf) by conjectures and imaginations, and probabilities, and the like, and if I be admitted I ſhall thus ſay; that whereas you ſay, that the word <hi>PLACE</hi> is to be underſtood Church Power; I ſay that the word <hi>NAME,</hi> is that which ſignifieth Church Power in Scripture, and in reaſon more properly than the word <hi>PLACE;</hi> for it is ſaid, that God gave Jeſus a <hi>NAME above every NAME, that at the NAME of Jeſus every knee ſhould bow, both of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth:</hi> Now if we ſimply underſtand it as a <hi>NAME,</hi> there were other which were Named Jeſus as well as the Lord Jeſus: But by <hi>NAME,</hi> I underſtand ſignifieth Power, that Chriſt had all Power in heaven and earth reſigned up into his hands, and ſo his <hi>NAME</hi> ſignifieth his Power, and alſo it hath been a Proverb (formerly) We charge you in the Kings <hi>NAME,</hi> meaning by his Power or Authority: much more I could ſay, but enough to prove the word
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:119763:70"/>
                     <hi>NAME</hi> to ſignifie Power, and if ſo, then the power is to be an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting power, and Throne, (viz. <hi>PLACE</hi>) and ſo to remain to all generations: I could (peradventure) alligorize the Scriptures, and make them ſerve my own imaginations, and carry a very fair face that wayes, and thereby be like unto one hopping in the Clouds, and lead other after me, but theſe things I do proteſt againſt, and endeavour nothing more (if my heart deceive me not) than to know and declare Chriſt Jeſus and his Laws, in the plainneſs and ſimplicity of them, as they were delivered to (and practiſed by) the primitive Churches, whoſe footſteps we ought to walk in, agreeing with that Propeſie, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. in theſe words, <hi>We will not hide them from their Children, ſhewing to the generations to come, the praiſe of the Lord, for he hath eſtabliſhed a Teſtimony in</hi> Jacob, <hi>and appointed a Law in</hi> Iſrael, <hi>which he commanded our Fathers that they ſhould make them known to their Children, that the generations to come might know them; walk about Zion, and go round about her, tell the Towers thereof,</hi> mark ye well <hi>her bull-works, conſider her Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that ye may tell it to the generations following; FOR I have made a covenant with my choſen, thy ſeed will I eſtabliſh for ever, and build up thy Throne to all generations,</hi> wherefore, <hi>Glory be to God in the Church by Chriſt Jeſus through all ages, World without end A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Epheſ.</hi> 3. laſt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.3, 4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 48.12, 13. And now I ſhall only ſum up all in a few words, and paſs from this particular. And the firſt is,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That <hi>every thing hath its beginning, and continuance from the word of God,</hi> ſaith Mr. <hi>Henden,</hi> and yet did ſay (in the above mentioned Conference) to Captain <hi>Tucker</hi> when he urged a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture command for to warrant the practice of Baptiſme in our age, ſaid, that a command to warrant the practice of it was not ſufficient, unleſs it were accompanied with the ſame power, the which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive agreeth not together.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Baptiſme and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, did not ceaſe in all the time of Apoſtacy, B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>T DID REMAIN</hi> practicable as a duty to be practiſed, it having a word for its continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; and yet to my beſt underſtanding of his practice (by informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) he practiſeth neither of them, and thereby condemns himſelf in the thing that he alloweth, and therefore its juſt with God to give him up to blindneſs.</p>
                  <p>Again, as for his cited place, <hi>Iſa,</hi> 56.5. to prove ſome of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, to ceaſe; is anſwered: as,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:119763:70"/>Firſt, by ſhewing it was not a propheſie of the primitive Goſpel Church, becauſe the primitive Goſpel Church was to offer no burnt offering and ſacrifice upon the Altar, as theſe were to do, and to be accepted in ſo doing, but theſe things were taken out of the way, and not to be mentioned amongſt a Goſpel Church; for ſo ſaith the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>ſacrifice and offering, and burnt offerings thou wouldſt not, neither hadſt thou pleaſure in them; but a body haſt thou prepared.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, the Gentiles were then under thoſe ſacrifices joyned to God.</p>
                  <p>Again, its proved that the <hi>PLACE</hi> is as everlaſting as the <hi>NAME,</hi> and that <hi>NAME</hi> in Scripture ſignifieth power more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly than <hi>PLACE:</hi> And thus I paſs to the next proof, or reaſon, to prove the ceſſation of ſome of Chriſts Ordinances, cited by Mr. <hi>Henden,</hi> which is; ſaith he,</p>
                  <p>Turn to, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Where you may obſerve, that to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of</hi> Peters <hi>faith, and Chriſt the rock believed: is fore-ſpoken that the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it; but</hi> verſ. 19. <hi>The keyes of binding and looſing, opening and ſhutting, are ſet after <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>as having no ſuch promiſe annexed to them; and why ſhould this be but to ſhew that theſe keyes in the Churches hand, ſhould have a ſink and be looſed for their efficacy for a time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> From what you ſay here, I underſtand you do believe (or at leaſt admit of it) that the Gates of Hell ſhall never prevail againſt the Church of Chriſt, but that there ſhall be one in all ages, only this Church is to looſe her keyes (as you think) ſo as not to bind and looſe, open and ſhut; that is, (as I underſtand) not to receive in, nor to caſt out; and how this Church ſhall come to looſe her keyes I know not, (although I have well peruſed what you ſay concerning the ſtar that fell from Heaven to Earth) for God will not take away the keyes (that I can find) from the Church and Devils (or wicked men) cannot take them away, for <hi>the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it,</hi> how then ſhall theſe keys come to be looſt? I am a think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what you might have ſaid, from <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. That while ſhe ſlumbred and ſlept, ſhee let them fail out of her hands; but I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that if ſhe had ſo done, ſhe would have took them up again, when ſhe was awake; but you ſay, that <hi>there was a ſtar fell from Heaven to Earth, that had the key of the bottomleſs pit,</hi> viz. an evil Angel, (or Miniſter as I underſtand you) <hi>which had uſurped all Church power into his cuſtody, totally apoſtated from Heaven to Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and becomes a meer earthly Angel, by which the Church policy that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:119763:71"/>
before was a Kingdome of Heaven, is become a bottomleſs pit, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the keyes of the celeſtial Kingdome, was another contrary key of the ſame bottomleſs pit, the key being the ſame with the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The particulars (conſiderable) are theſe; as firſt, <hi>there was an Angel that had uſurped all Church power into his cuſtody,</hi> (ſay you:) To which I ſay, me thinks its very ſtrange, that an Angel ſhould uſurp all Church power into his cuſtody, ſure it was not while he was in Heaven, nay, but I remember it was after he was fallen to Earth; and then it was not the key of the Kingdome of Heaven (viz. the power of the true Church) corrupted, but it was another key (viz. another power) ever the key and power of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and indeed it cannot be rationally imagined (as I think) that an Angel (that is to ſay or Miniſter) ſhould carry all the power and authority away of all the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> which had ſeven Angels belonging unto them, and not only thoſe ſeven Churches, but alſo many other Churches, that were then extant upon earth; ſo then if the Angel received his key after his fall (the which he did read, <hi>Revel.</hi> 9.1, 2, 3, 4.) then it could not be the key of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven <hi>CORR<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>PTED,</hi> but another key given to him, namely the key of the bottemleſs pit; and what proof is this to prove that all Church power was loſt, when an Angel (viz. or Miniſter) fell away from Heavenly mindedneſs, to earthly mindedneſs; let the rational Reader Judge.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the keyes ſpoken of (<hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18.) were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the Churches hands for ever, is very plainly proved in the Scripture; as,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, From the words of our bleſſed Saviours own mouth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.18, 19, 20. in theſe words, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ye,</hi> (viz. the Church) <hi>ſhall blind on earth, ſhall be bound in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and whatſoever ye ſhall looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in HEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>EN:</hi> from theſe words we may ſee, that Chriſt hath given his Church power to deal with offenders and to bind them, that is, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude them from that Communion of Saints; and that it is to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuated is plain, becauſe it is annexed to <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. which is perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, as is moſt evident: Thus we may ſee in the firſt place, that Chriſt did once give his Church his power, and never took it away again from them, and the power, and ſtrength of Hell cannot do it. For <hi>the Gates of Hell ſhall not prevail againſt it;</hi> and ſurely the falling of one Star from Heaven to Earth (namely the fall of one Miniſter)
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:119763:71"/>
could not diſpoſſeſs the whole body of Chriſt, (namely, his Church in all places conſiſting of many particular Churches, and Stars or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters) of all their power that Chriſt gave unto his body, the Church; it being further conſidered, <hi>that the Gates of Hell was not to prevail againſt it;</hi> take this compariſon.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe the Conſtable of <hi>Benenden</hi> ſhould loſe his power (as an Officer) by reaſon of his rebellion, doth it therefore follow that all the Conſtables in the ſeven hundreds (or in that diviſion) have loſt their power, who have not rebelled, and the ſeveral Pariſhes thereby loſe their power, ſo as they cannot execute the Law upon offenders? which if ſo, it is a Paradox unto me; even ſo, if one Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Church, or one Miniſter and Church ſhould fall away, and ſo loſe their true power, and in the room thereof, take up the power of darkneſs; doth it therefore follow that all the other Churches and Miniſters (which did not fall) ſhould loſe their power alſo? ſurely no, there is no reaſon to be given to prove it: but we find there was but one <hi>STAR</hi> (in the ſingular number) and not <hi>STARS</hi> (in the plural number) that fell, and therefore to ſay, becauſe one Miniſter fell and loſt his place, and true power, therefore there muſt needs be a ſink of all Miniſters, and power; is all one, as if I ſhould ſay, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Judas</hi> fell and loſt his power and Apoſtle-ſhip; therefore there was no Apoſtle-ſhip nor power upon Earth, which to ſay, would be rediculous, and yet there is as good reaſon for the one as for the other, but indeed no reaſon at all for neither; ſo then the ſum of what can be ſaid from, <hi>Revel.</hi> 9.1, 2, 3. Is, that there was a <hi>STAR</hi> that fell from Heaven to Earth, and worked wickedneſs (that is) one Miniſter fell from Heaven (that is to ſay) from the Heavenly Church ſtate, to an Earthly Church ſtate, from the Oracles of God, to the traditions of men, and ſo it might be (and was) that one Miniſter amongſt many might fall, and yet the reſt ſtand faſt; as it was with many in the primitive age, and this is all which can be ſaid from <hi>Revelations</hi> 9. And,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That Church power was perpetuated, and to remain af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe Apoſtles Death, amongſt the Churches, is plain, becauſe the ſucceſſive Miniſters and Churches were to uſe the ſame practice of receiving and rejecting, as we may read, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.14.</p>
                  <p>And your own principle alloweth of it, for you do affirm, that the practice of the Lords Supper is perpetuated, and to remain in all ages; and ſuppoſe you did do, what you judge is your duty to do, (namely
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:119763:72"/>
obſerve) and keep the Lords Supper, it muſt alſo of neceſſity be your own practice; for ſuppoſe that one of your communicates that appeared to be a civil honeſt religious man, but laſt Lords day, and one which ye much delighted in: but peradventures before the next Lords day, he appears to be an hypocrite (even a drunkard, or a fornicator, or the like) now will you admit of that man (although formerly he had communion with you, to have communion with you now when he appears both to you and all men (that behold him) to be a ſcandalous and prophane man, I hope not: and if another man of the great or little Bodies (as you call them) ſhould proffer to have communion with you, (whom you judge godly) would you not admit of him? ſurely yea; and if ſo, conſider at your lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, how much leſs this is than receiving, and rejecting, taking in, and caſting out, binding and looſing; conſider well, (if yours were a congregation approved of by Chriſt) the danger of ſuch as ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and the benefit of ſuch as ye admit of; and indeed my opinion is, that the great reaſon why ye do not practiſe that Ordinance, is, becauſe if you did, then you would be neceſſitated to receive in, and caſt out, or otherwiſe, you would have ſuch a communion as the very worldlings would hiſſe at; but now that you may ſhuffle a company together of all ſorts, and inlarge your Tents, rather than you would let go ſome (the which you would be aſhamed of, if yours were a communion of Saints) you let go Chriſts Ordinance, and ſo condemn your ſelf in the things that you allow; and indeed I do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it ſeems very ſtrange to me, that any man that hath but a face of zeale in Religion and godlineſs, that they will aſſociate themſelves with you in ſpiritual things, for I do aſſure you, that I ſhould be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cautious how I had any communion with a man that liveth in the breach of that which he knoweth to be his duty to do, fearing that he that makes but little conſcience (or indeed no conſcience) in one duty, will make as little conſcience in another, provided it be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant with his credit or reputation. But to paſs theſe things, I ſhall give an argument to prove the continuation of receiving, and rejecting, binding and looſing: which is,</p>
                  <p>If there be ſuch a conjunction between keeping the Lords Supper, and receiving, and rejecting, as that the Lords Supper cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main practicable, and to be practiſed, ſo as to be approved of God, without it; then receiving in, and caſting out, is as perpetual as the Lords Supper.</p>
                  <p>But there is ſuch a conjunction between the keeping of the Lords
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:119763:72"/>
Supper, and receiving, and rejecting; ſo that the Lords Supper can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not remain practicable, and to be practiſed, ſo as to be approved of by God without it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Ordinance of receiving and rejecting, is as perpetual as the Lords Supper, and one to attend the other. The major is undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; that is to ſay, (in ſhort thus) if receiving in, and caſting out, be an Ordinance of ſuch conſequence, as the Lords Supper cannot remain to be practiſed without it; then it of neceſſity will follow, that if one remain practicable ſo doth the other, and Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> ſaith one doth remain, namely, the Lords Supper.</p>
                  <p>And the minor I ſhall prove, that one cannot remain practicable without the other; that is to ſay, that without receiving into the Church, and caſting out of the Church, the Ordinance of the Lords Supper cannot remain practicable and practiſed, ſo as the Lord will approve of it: and if ſo, receiving into communion and caſting out, (<hi>viz.</hi> binding and looſing) is perpetuated and to remain as well as the Lords Supper: but now to prove the minor, namely, that the Lords Supper cannot remain practiſed, ſo as to be approved of by God, without receiving in and caſting out; is firſt, perſons muſt have a time to be received into the viſible Church of Chriſt, one way or other, unleſs perſons are born members of Chriſts Church, the which I think none will affirm, becauſe Chriſt ſaith, that <hi>unleſs a man be borne again, he cannot enter into the Kingdome of God; for that which is born of fleſh, is fleſh, and that which is born of Spirit, is Spirit; marvel not that I ſay unto thee, that thou muſt be borne again:</hi> And that it was the practice of the primitive Churches to receive in her members, is clear from theſe Scriptures, and many more that might be added, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.2. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.13, 14. 3 <hi>John</hi> 10. So that if there be not a continual adding to the Church daily ſuch as ſhall be ſaved, then Chriſts Houſe will be quickly empty.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If there be not alſo a caſting out, the Lords Supper cannot remain practiſed, ſo as the Lord will accept of it, for the Lord hath commanded, that if any be a fornicator, or covetous, or extortioner, or an idolator, or a drunkard, or a railor, that the Church ſhould not have communion with him, no not with ſuch an one to eat; and that there hath been ſuch in the Church of God, and have been caſt out when they have been diſcovered, read 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. from the firſt verſe to the 12. and that it is ſo in our dayes, is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeen, that there be ſome that ſeem to walk a while as Chriſtians,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:119763:73"/>
and then who can deny them the Lords Supper? and not long after do ſhew themſelves wicked and prophane, and then who dares to adminiſter it unto them, and who dares to eat with them, becauſe the Lord hath forbid it? And therefore to ſay, that the Churches may and ought to break bread (<hi>viz.</hi> eat the Lords Supper) at ſuch a time as ſhe hath loſt her power to deal with the wicked, and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous (ſo far as to exclude them) is no leſs than to ſay, that Chriſt is a tranſgreſſor in building the things the which he hath deſtroyed; and will not the Church then be a cage of all manner of unclean birds, or is it not as frequently ſeen, that there be apoſtates in our dayes, as in the primitive age? and in ſhort take this maxime, that take either a Common-wealth without its power in government, namely power to bind and looſe, (in Civils,) and a Family without its power in government, and a Church of Chriſt without its power in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and you ſhall ſee that the beſt of it will be a lump of confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and at the end come to deſtruction, or be a deſolation: ſo then the ſum of all is this in ſhort, that if the Ordinance of the Lords Supper, be perpetuated and to ramain in the greateſt times of apoſtacy, then the power of the Church alſo did remain, becauſe it is impoſſible for perſons to eat the Lords Supper, ſo as for God to approve of it, if the Church have not power to exclude offenders, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe with ſuch the Church may not eat, nor have no fellowſhip in Spiritual things, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. And that ſuch were and will be found in the viſible Church till they be purged out, the Scriptures and our experience witneſſeth daily; from whence we may ſee, that if the Church have not loſt that precious Ordinance of the Lords Supper, neither hath ſhe loſt her keyes of binding and looſing, namely, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving in, or caſting out, although one Star fell, from Heaven to Earth, <hi>Revel.</hi> 9. yet he carryed not away the heavenly keyes, or power, no more than the evil Angels when they fell could carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the heavenly power and authority of the good Angels; no, they were ſo far from carrying away the power that the good Angels had, that the power that the evil Angels had was taken away and given to the good Angels; as the one Talent was taken and given to him that had ten; ſo to him that hath ſhall be given, and to him that hath not ſhall be taken away that which he hath: ſo then the concluſion is, that if one Star did fall, its nothing in compariſon of many Stars which did not fall; and that fallen Star, did not carry away the keyes of the Kingdome of Heaven, namely, the heavenly power, but God took
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:119763:73"/>
it away from him, and the Devil gave him the keyes of drakneſs, ſo it was not the keys of the Kingdome, for they ſtill remained with them, that abode in the truth; as hath been already proved, and by your ſelf (in effect) hath been granted: and thus I paſs to the next thing conſiderable; which is,</p>
                  <p>The four Winds, <hi>Revel.</hi> 7.1. with its interpretation by Mr. <hi>Henden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But by the way I take notice of what is ſaid in the beginning of his 4. page, from <hi>Zech.</hi> 4. which ſpeaks concerning their building of Jeruſalem and the Temple, after the ſeventy years of captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> the which he applies to be a Goſpel Church; and <hi>the Pipes there ſpoken of, to be underſtood Ordinances, and from the ſeven Pipes ſpoken of,</hi> verſ. 2. <hi>is to be underſtood the practiſing of the full number of Ordinances in the Primitive time; and the two Golden Pipes, in</hi> verſ. 12. <hi>Is to be underſtood the leaſt of numbers, and that leaſt of numbers relates to the time of the Churches being in</hi> Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, <hi>that then the leſſer number of Ordinances were practicable, and to be practiſed.</hi>

                  <p>This is the ſum in ſhort that I gather from that (his) diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer briefly; and firſt, that the 4 <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Zech.</hi> is a Propheſie of a Goſpel Church, I cannot (as yet) ſee nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; it is clear, that it was a propheſie of the redifying of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi> and the Candelſtick, the Lamps and Pipes belonging to it, is the ſame veſſels that God appointed in the Temple, as you may read <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. <hi>Lev.</hi> 24.4. <hi>Numb.</hi> 4.9. the oyle veſſels miniſtering un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, is to be underſtood the Pipes) <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.2. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.10. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.15. from theſe and many more Scriptures that might be added, we may ſee, that the Candleſtick, with the Lamps, and Pipes, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the miniſtering veſſels unto the Lamps and Candelſtick, was the ſame that God ſhewed unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the pattern, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed it to remain in the Temple, and after that pattern, it was made in <hi>Solomons</hi> time, and the very ſame was to be after the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years of captivity; and it is far more evident, becauſe if we obſerve the Propheſie of <hi>Haggai,</hi> who ſpeaks of one and the ſame thing, he will tell us, that <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> (according to <hi>Zechariahs</hi> words) that he ſhould lay the foundation, and alſo finiſh it, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.9. and that this propheſie relates to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> read <hi>Haggai,</hi> and <hi>Zechariah</hi> at large; I do not ſay, that it relates only to the rebuilding of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the Temple at the end of the ſeventy years captivity, but in it is a Propheſie of the redifying of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:119763:74"/>
the City and Temple, deſtroyed ſince by <hi>Titus Veſpatian,</hi> which is yet to be built again according to the Word of the Lord, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. but more of that anon; but in a ſhort ſentence, I further add this as a reaſon to prove, that the Propheſie of <hi>Zechariah, Chap.</hi> 4. moſt primely relates to the redifying of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> at their coming out of the ſeventy years of captivity, becauſe that both <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zechariah,</hi> have the Word of the Lord coming to them both at that time, as to <hi>Haggai</hi> the Word of the Lord came to him in the ſixth &amp; ſeventh month, in the ſecond year of <hi>Darius, Chap.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.1. and to <hi>Zechariah</hi> it came in the eighth month, in the ſame year, <hi>Zech.</hi> 1.1. and the work of both Prophets was to ſtir up the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the work of building of the Houſe of God; for they being hindred (by ſubtilty) in the dayes of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> becauſe that <hi>Zerubba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and the reſt of the chief of the Fathers, would not let the people of the Land build with them, as you may ſee at large in, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. that they at laſt out of cuſtome grew careleſs, and was content to live in their ſealed houſes, and let the houſe of God lye waſte, <hi>Hag.</hi> 1.2. and hence the Word of the Lord ſtirred them up, by the two fore mentioned Prophets, namely, <hi>Haggai</hi> and <hi>Zechariah,</hi> that they might go on to finiſh the Work, for <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> had begun it before, and laid the Foundation in the daies of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and being ſtopped as before ſaid, he was to finiſh it in the daies of <hi>Darius;</hi> which agreeth with the words of <hi>Zechariah, Chap.</hi> 4.9. in theſe words, <hi>The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this houſe, his hands alſo ſhall finiſh it;</hi> compare <hi>Haggai</hi> with the four firſt <hi>Chapters</hi> of <hi>Zechariah,</hi> and compare them both with, <hi>Ezra</hi> 3.8.9, 10. <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. and you may clearly ſee, that what I have ſaid is undeniably true; and that is the thing that <hi>Zechariah</hi> ſpeaks of, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. which Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> would have to be a Goſpel Church; it's clear that men may be carried away very ſtrangely, in the judgments and underſtandings, if that they be guided by their own ſpirits, or immaginations, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſearching the Scriptures, and well comparing them together, ſo as they may hold a correſpondency together; I am not willing to be nice in obſerving obſurdities, the which if I were, and had time I could obſerve many; but at preſent I ſhall leave this thing, ſaying, that if the Pipes ſignifie the Ordinances of the Goſpel, and that they were loſt from ſeven to two; ſo that there is now but two Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances practicable, (and it's a queſtion to ſome whether Mr. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> practiſe above one of them two) what Ordinances they be which
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:119763:74"/>
remain? but you ſay that the two ſignifie the leaſt of numbers, and ſo I think that two is the leaſt of numbers: but that I may take you in the beſt ſenſe, I underſtand you mean, that the Ordinances was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in two numbers, and the biggeſt number was to ceaſe in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> (as you call it) and the leſſer number to be perpetuated and remain; the which if ſo, caſt up your account again, and you will find upon your own account, that the greater number is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated and to remain: as, 1. Miniſtry, 2. Prayer, 3. Praiſes, 4. Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, 5. the Lords Supper, 6. the Sealed elect number, 7. the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual union, 8. the beginning and profeſſion of faith, 9. the duties of charity; all theſe are acknowledged by you to be perpetuated and to remain.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the other number; as, 1 Confirmation, 2 Ordination, 3 Church-Cenſure, 4 Church-ſtating; theſe are corrupted, and are ceaſed as you ſay; and which of theſe is the greateſt number I leave the wiſe to judge: from whence they may ſee, that the two Pipes ſhould not parallel with the perpetuated Ordinances; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall leave them as excellent in their proper place and ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but altogether of an uncertain ſound as they have been apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not fit for perſons to dance after: and thus I leave this particular, and come to ſpeak ſomewhat to the four Winds, <hi>Revel.</hi> 7.1.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The four Winds,</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Henden</hi>) Page 4. <hi>Is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, the Winds of the Spirit, the begetting and preſerving cauſe of theſe viſible keyes</hi> before ſpoken of, <hi>where by reaſon of the falling away, were wholly with-held from their apparent blaſt, and the cauſe failing, the effects muſt alſo ceaſe. Theſe four Angels we conceive to be evil Spirits, working by their principal Miniſters the four capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> Patryarchs <hi>of the Chriſtian World; to wit, the</hi> Biſhop <hi>of</hi> Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria <hi>for the</hi> South, <hi>of</hi> Antioch, <hi>for the</hi> Eaſt, <hi>of</hi> Conſtantinople, <hi>for the</hi> North, <hi>and</hi> Rome <hi>for the</hi> Weſt; <hi>who uſurping all eccleſiaſtical government into their hands, did by their contention and pride gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually detain the four Winds from breathing in the external rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, till at the laſt the head-ſhip fell into Rome,</hi> Page 29.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is many things laid down, the which I ſhall ſpeak to in particular, and that very briefly, becauſe I am much ſtraitned for time; and alſo I think there is ſo little coulour of truth in it, that few will believe it, whether I ſpeak any thing to it yea or nay: but becauſe I would not willingly miſs any thing that ſeems of weight in your eye, I ſhall examine the particulars, and firſt to the firſt; which is,</p>

                     <hi>The four Winds ſpoken of,</hi> Revel. 7.1. <hi>Is the Winds of the Spirit,</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Henden.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>In Anſwer to this, I ſhall cite the Text, and ſpeak little to it, but leave the Reader to Judge; ſee the Text, <hi>Revel.</hi> 7.1. in theſe words, <hi>And After theſe things, I ſaw four Angels ſtanding on the four cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the Earth, holding the four Winds of the EARTH, that the Wind ſhould not blow upon the Earth, nor on the Sea, nor on any green Tree;</hi> From theſe words we may take notice, that the four Winds, are called the Winds of the <hi>EARTH,</hi> (mark that) and wherever the Spirit of the Lord, or the breathings forth of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is called by the name of the four Winds of the Earth; I never yet read, although I have examined, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.4, 5. chap. 37.9.14. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.2. The which none of the places run parallel with <hi>Revelations</hi> 7.1. They are not called the four Winds of the Earth; as for <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiels</hi> viſion, <hi>chap.</hi> the firſt, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaw the Heavens opened (it was not the four Winds of the Earth, no but) a whirle-wind and a cloud from the <hi>OPEN HEAVENS</hi> (North-ward) in the which whirle-wind the Lord appeared to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> between the ſour living creatures, which were <hi>Cherubims;</hi> and we know it is uſual for the Lord to appear in a whirle-wind between the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> that thoſe living creatures ſpoken of in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.5. were <hi>Cherubims,</hi> and that the Lord dwelleth between or amongſt the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> is clear from <hi>chap.</hi> 10. compared with 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.4. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.15. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 80.1. and 99.1. And that which is ſpoken obſcurely in the firſt chap. of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> is more plainly expounded in <hi>Chap</hi> 10. where the living creatures ſpoken of in <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. are called <hi>Cherubims,</hi> in <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.20. in theſe words, <hi>This is the living creature that I ſaw under the God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>by the River</hi> Chebar, <hi>and I knew that they were Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims:</hi> Time would fail me to open the matter contained in the viſion, and the end of it, but enough to prove, that it relates not at all to the four Winds ſpoken of, in <hi>Revel.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as to the Winds ſpoken of, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.9. I ſay, that its only uſed by way of alluſion, becauſe our lives are called wind, (<hi>Job</hi> 7.7.) and <hi>Iſrael</hi> being in captivity, and ſo as dead men, the Lord ſheweth the <hi>Prophet Ezekiel,</hi> that he would revive them, and recover them out of their captivity, and bring them again into their own Land, <hi>verſ.</hi> 21. and alſo we may obſerve, that they muſt firſt have the breath of life and be brought out of their graves, which breath of life, to raiſe them from their graves, was to come from the four Winds; and then after this they were to be brought into their
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:119763:75"/>
own Land, and the Spirit of God was not to be poured out upon them while they were in captivity, but after they were come into their own Land at a ſet time, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.9, 10, 11. which ſheweth that Wind ſpoken of there, was not that Spirit which you aim at, which if it were, yet it holds no agreement with the text cited by you, <hi>Revel.</hi> 7.1. becauſe it is not called the Winds of the Earth, for there is the Winds of the Earth, and there is the Winds of Heaven, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.8. <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.4. <hi>Zech.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.31. <hi>Revel.</hi> 7.1.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To the Text cited by you, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.2. in theſe words, <hi>And ſuddenly there came a ſound FROM Heaven, as of a ruſhing mighty wind,</hi> &amp;c. from theſe words we may ſee, that this Wind came from <hi>HEAVEN,</hi> and ſo was not that Wind ſpoken of, in <hi>Revel.</hi> 7. Becauſe that was the four Winds of the <hi>EARTH,</hi> (mark that.)</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it doth not ſay, that there came a Wind from Heaven and ſate upon each of them, but cloven tongues which ſate upon each of them, and the ſound was like unto a mighty ruſhing Wind; it doth not ſay it was a Wind that blew, but there was heard a ſound as it were a mighty ruſhing Wind; ſo then the ſound of it was as it were (or) like a Wind, and every likeneſs is not the ſame; but why need I keep ſuch a ſtir about this Wind, I remember Mr. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> ſaith in his 28. <hi>Page,</hi> and <hi>line</hi> 19, 20. that the with-holding the Winds of the Spirit hurt not the elect, his words are theſe; <hi>all ſave the elect were hurt thereby and ſubverted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From whence we now learn, from what Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> ſaith in this place, that it was from the reprobate that the Winds of the Spirit was with-held from blowing on them: This is that I underſtand from his words, if I underſtand him aright; unleſs there be a third ſort of men, that is to ſay, the elect and reprobate, and another ſort which is neither elect nor reprobate; and if this be Mr. <hi>Hendens</hi> opinion, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that the with-holding of the Winds of the Spirit, did not hurt the elect but the reprobate, then one of us have fought (as it were) with our own ſhadow, for it was ever my judgment ſince I knew any thing of God, that Gods holy Spirit was ever with-held from the reprobate, they having no part or portion in it; And thus I paſs the ſour Winds at preſent, and come to ſpeak ſomewhat briefly to the Angels; (which is) ſaith Mr. <hi>Henden,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Angels</hi> ſpoken of <hi>Revel.</hi> 7.1. <hi>we conceive</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to be evil Spirits, working by their principal Miniſters, the four capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Patryarchs of the Chriſtian World; to wit, the Biſhop of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:119763:76"/>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Methinks it's very ſtrange Doctrine to be publiſhed, or to be believed, (namely to ſay) that evil Spirits ſhould have power to hold the good Spirits, and ſo the good Spirit (or the Spirit of God) to become as it were ſubordinate to the evil; that God ſhould put his Spirit into the hands of the Devil: I have read in (<hi>Acts</hi> 7.51. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.19.) that wicked <hi>MEN</hi> may reſiſt the counſel of God, (or Spirit of God againſt themſelves) and quench the workings of the Spirit of grace within themſelves, whereby they ſhould be Sealed unto the day of Redemption: But I never yet read, that the Devil or wicked men could hinder the working of Gods Spirit in or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his Church; and to think that God would give his good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to be holden by and among wicked Spirits, is very vain and rediculous; for what concord hath Chriſt with <hi>Belial?</hi> or what fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip hath light with darkneſs, or God with the Devil?</p>
                  <p>But peradventure ſome will ſay, we cannot (indeed) readily believe, that ever God gave his Spirit into the cuſtody of evil Spirits to hold; Therefore what Angels do you think they were, and what were the Winds?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Angels I underſtand to be the Angels of the Lord, who are Miniſtring Spirits, ſometimes to adminiſter bleſſings; but now ſent forth by God to execute his Judgments upon the great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, after the Man-child was caught up to God, &amp; to his Throne; for it followeth in the nick of time, even when the Heaven is rowled together like a ſerouſe, <hi>Revel.</hi> 6.14, 15, 16. (to the great amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that will be at the ſign of the Son of man coming in the clouds of Heaven, with power and great glory) and at that time woe be to the inhabitants of the earth and ſea, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.12. becauſe of the Devils being come down, and then ſhall go forth the ſeven An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to pour out their Vials upon the earth; and at that time alſo ſhall the four Angels (that held the four Winds) execute their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, at which time there ſhall fall grievous and noyſome ſores upon thoſe that have received the mark of the Beaſt, <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.1, 2, 3. That both Sea and Land ſhall be infected, and the Sun ſcorching (with heat) every green tree, and the Sons of men alſo; and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Winds being with-held, the earth, Sea and Rivers, and Fountains of water, together with the Sons of men, ſhall be ſo ſcold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the heat of the Sun, that they ſhall be grievouſly perplexed, and ſhall blaſpheme the name of God becauſe of the plagues, <hi>Revel.</hi> 16.9. and the execution of theſe things, will be in the time of the Propheſie of the two witneſſes, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.6. compared with <hi>Zech.</hi> 5.1,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:119763:76"/>
2, 3. with <hi>Revel.</hi> 10.2. verſ. 10. chap. 11.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. the which (if the Lord will) I ſhall ſpeak to more at large anon, when I come to diſcover what the outward Court and holy City is, and of its being trod under foot, and who the woman is, which travaileth, and what the Man-child is, and of his being taken up to God, and to his Throne, of the flight of the woman into the Wilderneſs, and what Wilderneſs, and the time how long theſe things, with ſeveral other are ſo annexed together, that they are unſeperable; and thus I paſs, ſaying, that the Winds are to be underſtood according as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture calls them, namely, the ſour Winds of the <hi>EARTH:</hi> and thus I come to the next thing conſiderable; which is,</p>
                  <p>Of the outward Court and holy City, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.1, 2. in theſe words, <hi>And there was given me a reed like unto a rod, &amp; the Angel ſtood ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ariſe and meaſure the temple of God and the Altar, and them that worſhip therein, but the Court which is without the Temple leave out and meaſure it not, for it is given unto the Gentiles, and the holy City ſhall they tread under foot forty and two moneths; and I will give power to my two witneſſes, and they ſhall Propheſie a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore dayes, cloathed in ſackcloth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before I ſhall give you the expoſition of the Text, or unfold it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, I ſhall ſhew what Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> ſaith is the meaning of the Text; which is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>We maintain</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Temple to decypher the myſtical union, of the one hundred and forty four thouſand Sealed, or elected ones, whereby they are built up a ſpiritual houſe; and the Court without to be the externity of eccleſiaſtical order, which was eſtabliſhed by Chriſt in the primitive times,</hi> page 38. Paragraph 1. Section 4.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I know not any one Text that ſeems to bear a face to ſuch a thing, as the Temple to decypher the myſtical union of the one hundred forty and four thouſand Sealed ones, neither do I underſtand that the Sealed ones are, or can be applyed to the faithful Gentiles, without wreſting and abuſing the Text, for the Text tels us plainly, that they that are Sealed are the Tribes of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and reckoneth them according to their ſeveral Tribes, as you may read, <hi>Revel.</hi> 7.4, 5, 6, 7, 8. in theſe words, <hi>And I heard the number of them that were Sealed, an hundred and forty and four thouſand, of all the Tribes of the CHILDREN OF ISRAEL,</hi> (mark that) <hi>of the Tribe of J<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>DAH were Sealed twelve thouſand, of the Tribe of R<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>

of the Tribe of NEPTHALY were Sealed twelve thouſand, of the Tribe of MAN ASSES were Sealed twelve thouſand, of the Tribe of SIMEON were Sealed twelve thouſand, of the Tribe of LEVI were Sealed twelve thouſand, of the Tribe of ISSACHAR were Sealed twelve thouſand, of the Tribe of ZEB<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LON were Sealed twelve thouſand, of the Tribe of JOSEPH were Sealed twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, of the Tribe of BENJAMIN were Sealed twelve thouſand;</hi> the which amounts juſt to one hundred forty and four thouſand, there being twelve thouſand of every Tribe Sealed, for there is twelve Tribes, and twelve times twelve thouſand, is one hundred forty and four thouſand, the which were all of the Tribes of the Children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> ſo that thoſe that call them Gentiles wreſteth the Scripture, for the Scripture doth not only call them the Tribes of the Children of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> verſ. 4. but alſo repeateth every Tribe ſeverally, ſo plain, that it cannot without great abuſe to the holy Spirit be evaded; time would fail me to ſhew the particulars relating to this thing, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thus; it is evident by the Angel out of the Eaſt, that theſe twelve Tribes are to be ſealed in their fore-heads, to that end that when the Angels go forth to execute Gods Judgments upon the Earth, that they may be ſpared, when the ſeal of the living God is ſeen upon their fore-head, for this to be after the Man-child is caught up to God, and to his Throne, at which time the Gentile Church (which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be the Man-child) is to be in the Ark of their ſafety, being caught up to meet the Lord in the ayre, and then the Jews that look for their <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> it being the time that God hath promiſed that all <hi>Iſrael</hi> (viz. the natural ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi>) ſhall be ſaved, as it is written, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. They ſhall have the Seal of God, or the name of God written in their foreheads, to diſtinguſh them from the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of the Beaſt, who are to have the name of the Beaſt in their right hand, or forehead, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.16. upon whom the ſeven Angels are to pour out their vials upon the earth, that the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have received the mark of the Beaſt in their foreheads, or hands, may be tormented, and then the executing Angels will paſs by all thoſe that have the Seal of God in their forehead, ſo that they ſhall not be plagued with thoſe Judgments that ſhall be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the Beaſt and his worſhippers; and to this end the Angel of the Eaſt forbid the four Angels that had power to hurt the earth, that they might not go forth to execute their office, till the ſervants of God were Sealed in their foreheads, <hi>Revel.</hi> 7.2. And this agreeth with the manner of Gods dealing with his people, when he executes
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:119763:77"/>
his Judgments upon the earth, as you may ſee, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4, 5, 6. and to that end was theſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Sealed; ſo that none of the plagues either of the four Angels, or the ſeven Angels did them any hurt. And thus much at preſent of the Sealed number who they are, and the Cauſe of their being Sealed, and afterwards was ſeen preſerved as a Sealed number, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 15.2, 3, 4. And ſo I paſs to give my opinion what the Temple and the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Court, and holy City is.</p>

                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:119763:78"/>That the City and Temple is to be built, you have heard ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what from the Prophets, (to witneſs it) but further you may ſee, that there will be a Temple, (although not the union of the ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed number, as Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> ſuppoſed, which hath been already an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered) but a material Temple, as ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4. <hi>He</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the man of Sin or Antichriſt) <hi>ſhall ſit in the Temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God:</hi> But if the Temple be to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, to diſcypher the Miſtical union of the one hundred forty and four thouſand, (as Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> ſaith) then it is impoſſible that the Man of Sin ſhould ſit there, for they are not to be hurt; and that connot be ſaid to be the Temple of God in a ſpiritual ſenſe, which is the ſeat of the Man of Sin; but in a material Temple it hath been ſo already, and will be ſo again, for ſaith Chriſt, <hi>It is written, my Houſe ſhould be a Houſe of Prayer, but ye have made it a den of thiefs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, that there is to be a Temple, is alſo proved from <hi>Revel.</hi> 15.8. in theſe words, <hi>And the Temple was filled with ſmoak from the glory of God, from his power, and no MAN was able to enter into the TEMPLE, till the ſeven plagues of the ſeven Angels were fulfilled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From hence we ſee, that there ſhall be a material Temple which ſhall be ſo filled with Gods glory, that no <hi>MAN</hi> ſhall enter into it, until the plagues of the ſeven Vials be executed, and ſo Chriſt by the brightneſs of his coming and excellent glory, ſhall diſpoſſeſs the Man of Sin of his ſeat: and that the glory of God did ſhine ſo of old in his Temple, read the words of the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 10.4.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, that the glory of the Lord is to appear, or fill his Houſe or material Temple. Again, read <hi>Ezek.</hi> 43.5, 6, 7. in theſe words, <hi>So the Spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner Court, and behold the glory of the Lord filled the Houſe; and I heard him ſpeaking unto me out of the Houſe, and the man ſtood by me, and he ſaid unto me, Son of man, the place of my Throne, and the place of the ſole of my feet, where I will dwell in the midſt of the children of Iſrael for EVER, and my holy Name ſhall the Houſe of Iſrael no more defile.</hi> Agreeable to <hi>Chap.</hi> 37.21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. as you may read at large.

                  <p>Thirdly, what is to be underſtood by the outward Court, not meaſured or caſt out, or left out (as in reference to meaſurement) it is, that after the Iſraelites be returned, before they have finiſhed their outward Courts, and walls, and the like; for their great care and firſt work ſhall be upon the chief and principal place, <hi>viz.</hi> their City and Temple) the Gentiles, namely, <hi>Gogg</hi> the Prince of <hi>Meſhech</hi> and <hi>Tubal,</hi> whoſe Army ſhall be of them of <hi>Perſia, Ethiopia,</hi> and <hi>Libia,</hi> with <hi>Gomer,</hi> and the Family of <hi>Togarmah,</hi> a very great Army of the North Quarters, ſhall be gathered together upon the Mountains of Iſrael, and ſhall prevail, and ſpoil the Jews for a ſmall ſeaſon; and this ſhall be done before the outward Court and walls be finiſhed, which cauſeth the Army of the Gentiles, to call Jeruſalem a Town of unwalled Villages, being without Bars and Gates, as you may read, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38.11. in theſe words, <hi>And thou ſhalt ſay, I will go up to the Land of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NWALLED VILLAGES, I will go to them that are at reſt, that dwell ſafely, all of them dwelling without WALS, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving neither BARS nor GATES, to take a ſpoil, to take a prey,</hi> &amp;c.

From theſe Scriptures, and more that might be added, we may ſee, that the Walls and outward Court, ſhall not be finiſhed till it is taken, and the holy City trod under foot; but the time of its op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is ſo ſhort, as not worth ſpeaking of in compariſon of time, namely, three years and a half; ſo that this Prophet ſpeaks little of the oppreſſion of Iſrael, but doth (as it were) overlook it, becauſe the time of it is ſo ſhort, and ſpeaks of that which is of the greateſt moment, namely, the Enemies deſtruction; but the Prophet <hi>Zecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah</hi> agreeing with the <hi>Revelations</hi> ſheweth, that the City ſhall for a ſmall time be ſurpriſed and taken, and the Jews perſecuted, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the City it ſelf ſhall not be deſtroyed, but ſhall be the place of the Enemies Randeſvouz; and that this is true, read the words of the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> compared with <hi>Zechariah,</hi> which ſaith, <hi>He ſhall enter alſo into the glorious Land, and many Countries ſhall be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrown, but theſe ſhall eſcape out of his hands, even EDOM and MOAB, and the CHIEF OF THE CHILDREN OF AM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON; and he ſhall plant the Tabernacle of his Pallace between the Seas in the glorious holy mountain, yet he ſhall come to his end, and none ſhall help him: And at that time ſhall</hi> Michael <hi>ſtand up, the GREAT PRINCE, which ſtandeth for the Children of THY peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and there ſhall be a time of trouble, ſuch as never was ſince there was a Nation:</hi> For <hi>Behold the day of the Lord cometh, and thy ſpoil,</hi> (viz.

                  <p>From whence we may ſee, that Jeruſalem is to be trod under foot, according to the ſaying of the Text, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. and alſo the time how long, (which by <hi>Daniel</hi> is ſaid to be, a Time, and Times, and half a Time; and in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> Chap. 11.2. it is ſaid, to be Forty and two Months, in theſe words, <hi>But the Court which is without the Temple, leave out and meaſure it not, for it is given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Gentiles, and the holy City ſhall they tread under foot, forty and two months.</hi>

And that you may ſee, that the time of the Womans flight into the Wilderneſs, is the very time of the ſcattering of the holy People, (namely the People of the Jews, which <hi>Daniel</hi> frequently cals a holy People, for then they ſhall all be holy unto the Lord) and alſo the treading of the holy City underfoot, read <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.14. in theſe words, <hi>And to the Woman was given two wings of a great Eagle, that ſhe might flee into the Wilderneſs, into her place, where ſhe is nouriſhed for a Time, and Times, and half a Time, from the face of the Serpent.</hi> From all which hath been ſaid, I gather this Concluſion, (which materially offereth it ſelf) which is, That the Court without, which is not to be meaſured, is to be undeſtood, that the Jews are to return, and build their City and Temple; and the Court without not meaſured, but given unto the Gentiles, is to be underſtood, that the Families of the Gentiles (above ſpoken of) ſhall come to Jeruſalem, as to a Town of unwalled Villages, before the outward Court and Walls is finiſhed, and take it and divide the ſpoil; and the holy City being trod under foot, is to be underſtood, the ſpoil that will be made in Jeruſalem, for the ſpace of forty and two Months, in the which time, the two Prophets (or Witneſſes) ſhall

                  <p>To which I anſwer briefly in particulars: and,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if the forty and two months, and the one thouſand two hundred and threeſcore daies; with the <hi>TIME</hi> and <hi>TIMES,</hi> and halfe a <hi>TIME,</hi> (all which is acknowledged to be one and the ſame Time for the Latitude thereof) be expired and ended in the year 1950. then upon that account the Woman is come out of the Wilderneſs already, and hath been almoſt for ten years ſince, upon Mr. <hi>Hendens</hi> computation, (or calculation) of time; and if ſo, I hope Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> will admit, that the Woman may practiſe all the Ordinances as they were delivered; or if not, when ſhall ſhe? if it be anſwered, that ſhe is not to practiſe them till the Winds of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:119763:81"/>
the Spirit breath upon them again, and if this be the time, then is alſo as clear, that the ſpirit is entered into them again (from Mr. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi> own opinion;) for theſe two Prophets (ſaith Mr. <hi>Henden</hi>) were to Propheſie a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore years, in Sackcloath; which time was expired or ended, (as he ſaith) in the year 1650, and we find that when they had accompliſhed their Propheſies (which was accompliſhed at the time aforeſaid) then they were ſlain and lay dead, but three daies and a halfe; the which upon Mr. <hi>Hendens</hi> account is but three years and a halfe, at the end of which time the Spirit of life was to enter into them again, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.11. which was above ſix years ſince. <hi>Sir,</hi> look about you, its time for you to up and be doing, or to caſt up your account a new; but more to theſe things anon, when I come to ſhew my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, upon the travelling Woman and Man-child, and Witneſſe, as before ſaid, but I fear I ſhall be much ſtraitned for time.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It cannot be (as Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> ſaith) that the Winds of the Spirit is to be with-holden theſe forty and two months, or 1260. daies, ſo as that there ſhall not be that viſible demonſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of the ſpirit as in the Primitive time; for it is clear, that the two witneſſes in the time of their Propheſie in Sackcloath, ſhall have as great power, and viſible demonſtration as ever was known upon earth; that they have power, read <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.5, 6. in theſe words, <hi>If any wan will hurt them ſire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enimies; and if any man will hurt them, they muſt in this manner be killed; theſe have power to ſhut Heaven, that it raine not in the dayes of their Propheſie; and have power over waters to turn them into blood,</hi> Rev. 16.3, 4. <hi>and to ſmite the Earth, with all plagues as often as they will.</hi> For the Angels that hold the four Winds, &amp; the ſeven Angels, are imployed as miniſtering Spirits, both to deſend them from the malice of the Beaſt, ſo as he cannot hurt, or interrupt them all the time of their Propheſie, and alſo to pour out their Vyals, and with-hold the Winds, and ſmite the earth with curſes ſo often as they pleaſe: and that they did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo exerciſe their power in the time of their propheſie, is clear from <hi>verſ.</hi> 11. where it is ſaid, that <hi>They tormented the Earth;</hi> ſo then they had power, and did alſo exerciſe it, which confutes what Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> ſaith.</p>
                  <p>And thirdly, whereas Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> ſaith, in his <hi>page</hi> 65. that the true Church is only a Sealed number, diſ-robed of the beauty of her exteriour order.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="150" facs="tcp:119763:82"/>I anſwer &amp; ſay, it ſeems ſtrange to me, that the ſealed number which Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> (before) ſaid, was not hurt, and yet ſaith now that ſhe were diſ-robed of her beauty, in outward order: and if this be not hurt, I know not what is hurt, becauſe God did ever delight in outward Order, where there was inward grace, he being a God of Order, in all the Churches of his Saints.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It yet wants a proof, that ever the Woman loſt any one of her robes, (if ſhe be to be underſtood a Gentile Church (as Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> ſaith ſhe is) for ſhe had them on, when Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaw her in his viſion; and I do not read of any ever ſaw her without them, (after ſhe had put them on) unleſs Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> did; but I ſuppoſe he did not; and ſo I ſhall leave this particular, and paſs to the next particular, which is from the text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cited by M. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> and I ſhall not take notice of every circumſtance of things, but the ground of the matter wherein we differ: which is, ſaith he,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The marks of the falſe Churches, are four; as firſt, the viſibility in their ſtative order, loe here, or loe there.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſecond, the phraſe here and there, notes a manifeſt place of reſt or ſitting down.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, the variety here and there, which muſt Scatter, whereas the true is uniform.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly, The viſible, loe, or model, is firſt; and then Chriſt is brought into it, loe here is Chriſt; as if the Spirit of life, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine primitive power were in it; the Wilderneſs is to be underſtood a Metaphorical Wilderneſs; and ſecret Chambers, which figures out our leſſer ſtated bodies;</hi> and ſo forth, <hi>page</hi> 50, 51, 52.</p>
                  <p>In order to the anſwer of theſe things, I ſhall not take notice of every objection or contradiction, but ſhall plainly and briefly cite the text, and open it, and then leave the reader to judge, whether it ſpeak of gathered, or falſe conſtituted Churches, (as Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> ſaith, when it ſpeaks of the Wilderneſs, or deſart, or ſecret Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) or whether it be to be underſtood litterally, of a Material face, Chriſt in a deſart, or in a ſecret Chamber; and that we may come to underſtand it, let us obſerve the text as it is written, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.4, 5, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28. in theſe words, <hi>And Jeſus ſaid unto them,</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> his Diſciples) <hi>Take heed that no man deceive you. For many ſhall come in my name, ſaying, I AM CHRIST: and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive many. Then if they ſhall ſay unto you, Loe here is Chriſt, or there: beleeve it not. For there ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts, and falſe
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:119763:82"/>
Prophets, and ſhall ſhew great Signs and Wonders: inſomuch as if it were poſſible they ſhould deceive the very elect. Behold, I have told you before; Wherefore, if they ſhall ſay unto you, behold he is in the deſart, go not forth: behold he is in the ſecret Chamber, beleeve it not. For as the lightening cometh out of the Eaſt, and ſhineth into the Weſt: ſo ſhall alſo the coming of the Son of man be. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the carcaſſe is, there will the Eagles be gathered together.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Order to the opening of this Text, I ſhall devide it into ſeveral parts: and the firſt is, the Caution that Chriſt giveth to his Diſciples, which is, Take heed (ſaith he) that no man deceive you; and the reaſon is, becauſe many ſhall come in my name, and ſay I am Chriſt, and deceive many; the word <hi>Take heed that no man deceive you;</hi> is not only to be underſtood the Diſciples in that Age, but in all Ages ſucceſſively.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Obſerve the Word, <hi>ſaying, I am Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which relates to a Perſon, and not to a Fabrick, or a Model; more eſpecially, becauſe we know that Chriſt is to come as a ſingle perſon, as a Glorified man; and therefore ſuch as would feign him ſo as to make perſons believe that they are Chriſt, muſt come as a ſingle Perſon, although with attendance as he is to come.</p>
                  <p>And ſecondly, becauſe we know that it hath been the practiſe of ſome already, who have given out of themſelves, that they were ſome great one, even the Lord, or he that is to be King of the Jews, as <hi>BENCHOCAB</hi> and <hi>HACKIT,</hi> (as hath been already menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned) and more that might be mentioned, beſides in our dayes, he that profeſſed himſelf to be the great one, or King of the Jews, and drawed Diſciples after him, who lived in a Tent near <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> known to be truth, (together with) the late profeſſed Chriſt neer <hi>Briſtol,</hi> who was adored in the ſtreets, (as was creditably ſpoken of ſuch as heard it) with tho name <hi>HOSANNA, BLESSED IS HE THAT COMETH IN THE NAME OF THE LORD.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Becauſe that the Scripture ſheweth, that it is to be a perſon, and not a fabrick, or model, or form of worſhip; (falſe in its conſtitution) as firſt; from <hi>Dan,</hi> 8.23, 24, 25. compared with 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. for the Antichriſt denyeth (ſaith St. <hi>John</hi>) the Father and the Son, and he is an Antichriſt (that ſo doth) and St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>HE</hi> ſhall deny all that is called God, or worſhipped as God: And we know that <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge God, and worſhip him, (although in a falſe manner) but the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:119763:83"/>
Antichriſt ſhall deny both the Father and Son, and will not admit that any ſhall be worſhipped as God but himſelf; ſhewing himſelf that he is God: and to bring his deſign about, he ſhall cauſe craft to proſper in his hand, ſaith the Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> which is a perſon coming with ſigns and lying wonders, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3, 4, 5, 6. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.18, 19, 20, 31. agreeing with the Text it ſelf, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.24. (which ſaith) <hi>For there ſhall ariſe falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets,</hi> (not falſe conſtituted Churches) <hi>and ſhall ſhew great ſigns and wonders,</hi> &amp;c. From whence we may ſee, that the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt or falſe Chriſt, is a perſon or perſons, and not a falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, and Laſtly, it cannot be underſtood a form of worſhip, or a people ſet down to worſhip God in a form, becauſe the Text ſaith, <hi>if they ſay, loe here is Chriſt or there, believe it not;</hi> implying thus much, that Chriſt was not to be found here nor there, that is, no where in any form or worſhip in no Church whatſoever; and if this be true, then to be ſure Chriſt is not to be found in Mr. <hi>Hendens</hi> form, for Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> hath a form which he pretends he worſhips God in, to wit, a form of meeting together, a form of preaching, of praying, of praiſing, and a form of Baptiſme, and the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, (if he were true to his principles) which is either a form of worſhip or a lump of confuſion; for what is without form (in point of viſible worſhip) is confuſion. And what if Mr. <hi>Hendens</hi> Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were true, that is to ſay, if the Church were in the Deſart or Wilderneſs, hath Chriſt left his Church there alone without his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual preſenſe? ſurely no, he hath ſaid (and is faithful) that he will never leave and forſake his Church, ſo that whereſoever there be but two or three gathered together in his name, he will be preſent with them, and was he not with the Church in the Wilderneſs? <hi>Acts</hi> 7.38. yea, ſurely; it is not (rationally) thought that Chriſt will not be found in his own worſhip, by ſuch as worſhip him in truth and righteouſneſs of heart: ſo then the Text cannot be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted as Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> interprets it, becauſe Chriſt is to be found here and there, and indeed every where; (in his ſpiritual preſenſe) where two or three meet together in his name, if it be in the Deſart or Wilderneſs, he will be there, for he was with his Church in the Wilderneſs, and is the ſame yeſterday, to day and for ever: And therefore it cannot rationally be underſtood as Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets it; and thus I paſs what hath been ſaid to the Text by Mr. <hi>Henden,</hi> and in the next place ſhall ſhew you my opinion (briefly) upon the Text; which is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:119763:83"/>In this Text I obſerve many things, which were neceſſary to be ſpoken to if I had time, becauſe it holds correſpondency with <hi>Daniel, Joel, Zechariah,</hi> and the <hi>Revelations,</hi> but I ſhall only meddle with the point in controverſie; namely,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, What may be underſtood by the falſe Chriſt, and falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and of their ſigns and wonders.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Of the Deſart, or ſecret chambers,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Of the coming of the Son of man like lightning.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, and Laſtly, of the carkaſs, and the Eagles being gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto it: and theſe in order briefly, and firſt to the firſt; which is,</p>
                  <p>The falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets, I underſtand to be perſons who will come before the coming of the Lord Jeſus, (in the Clouds in power &amp; great glory) &amp; will affirm, that they are the Chriſt which was to come, the which ſome have done already, but that I conceive to be only the working of the myſtery of iniquity, which began in the Apoſtles dayes, as St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> declares, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.7, 8. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.18, 19. chap. 4.3. and that the height of that iniquity centereth in that Beaſt, and falſe Prophet, ſpoken of, in <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.4, 5, to the ſixteenth, <hi>chap.</hi> 19.19, 20. compared with <hi>Daniel,</hi> where he is called a vile Perſon, with the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> where he is called the Man of Sin, in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> where he is called <hi>Gogg,</hi> and again with <hi>Daniel</hi> where he is called the little Horn, and a King of a fierce countenance, underſtanding dark ſentences, who ſhall ſpeak mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous things againſt the God of Gods, denying all that is called God, and worſhipped, ſiting in the Temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God: and the ſigns and wonders ſpoken of in the Text, is thoſe miracles ſpoken of in <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.25. <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.13, 14, 15, 16. <hi>chap.</hi> 16.14. <hi>chap.</hi> 19.20. and more that might be added; I ſhall only ſpeak but a little to it more, becauſe I have ſpoken of it more at large in my book, intituled, <hi>Zions Redemption &amp; Original Sin;</hi> wherein al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo I have ſhewn the difference between the Romiſh <hi>Babylon,</hi> &amp; the Antichriſt; ſhewing them to be two, one different from the other: But at preſent I ſay, that the cauſe of theſe falſe Chriſts working ſigns and wonders, will be to deceive the elect, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Jews who are commonly called in Scripture the elect) that it is that people, namely the Jews, which he will endeavour to deceive, read <hi>Dan.</hi> 11. <hi>ult.</hi> chap. 12.1, 2, 7. <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.1, 2, 3. And his Throne ſhall be in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> amongſt the Jews, as I have (before) proved; and the Jews looking for Jeſus to come according to <hi>Daniels</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah's</hi>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:119763:84"/>
Propheſie, which ſaith, (<hi>Dan.</hi> 7.10.) <hi>Fiery ſtreams iſſued, and come forth from before him: thouſand thouſands miniſtred unto him,</hi> &amp;c. and the Man of Sin or the falſe Chriſt, ſhall have thouſand thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands to miniſter unto him: For his Army ſhall be very great, and that he may alſo have fiery ſtreams iſſue before him, that he may make the Jews believe that he is the true Chriſt, and thereby (if it were poſſible) deceive the Jews, (<hi>viz.</hi> the elect) he cauſeth fire to come down from Heaven in the ſight of men, to deceive them that live upon the face of the earth, <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.13. at which time the two Prophets ſhall begin their Propheſie, that they may eſtabliſh the Jews in the Teſtimony of Jeſus, and they ſhall work miracles indeed, ſuch as ſhall deſtroy all the former ones wrought by the falſe Chriſt, like as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod, eat up the Rods of the <hi>Magicians</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and as the falſe Chriſt ſhall have a falſe Prophet, or falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, that ſhall bear their Teſtimony, for the falſe Chriſt, (who will practiſe lying ſigns and wonders) even ſo the true Chriſt, ſhall have two witneſſes, or Prophets, who in truth &amp; uprightneſs ſhal bear their Teſtimony for the true Chriſt, (who not long after will deſcend upon the Mount of Olives, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.4.) which true Prophets ſhall as aforeſaid, do ſuch things, and miracles, that ſhall not only eat up (or deſtroy) the other that were falſe, but ſhall be a ſore puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Beaſt and falſe Prophet, and all that have received his mark in their hand or fore-head; that theſe Prophets and things ſhall ſtand up (and be done) in the very end of time. (as I may ſay) is clear, read the fore mentioned Prophets, and compare them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and you ſhall ſee it to be true; althought I do not deny, but there may have been ſome things done in the World already like it in one ſenſe or another, but the fulfilling of theſe Prophets, are to be expired very near the ſecond and glorious coming of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; &amp; thus I ſhall paſs to the ſecond thing fore mentioned; which is,</p>
                  <p>The Deſart or ſecret Chamber I underſtand, is his (<hi>viz.</hi> the falſe Chriſt) confining himſelf to a private place, to that end that he may be the more ſought after, and adored, for the more privately he contains himſelf, the more he will be ſought after, for mens fa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are ſet much upon novelties; hence the certain <hi>GREEK</hi> ſought to ſee Jeſus, <hi>John</hi> 12.20. And many have a deſire to ſee great ones, and more eſpecially if they be confined to privacy, but if he be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, he may paſs again and again and not be ſo ſought after, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they then can ſee and confer with him when they pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is a great means to deceive, for thoſe that are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:119763:84"/>
to ſee his majeſty, it's a thouſand to one if they be not deceived, partly by doting upon his majeſty, and partly by going contrary to Gods Word, gadding in their minds after vanity; and to this end he confines himſelf to ſecreſie, into ſecret places at his firſt coming; but ſaith Chriſt, <hi>behold I have told you before, go not after HIM;</hi> &amp; this brings me to the third particular, which is his reaſon why they ſhall not go to ſee a Chriſt in a Deſart, or ſecret Chamber; which is,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, becauſe (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>as the lightening cometh out of the Eaſt, and ſhineth even unto the Weſt,</hi> (or from one end of Heaven to the other) <hi>ſo ſhall alſo the coming of the Son of man be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The lightening I underſtand to be the Sun which lighteneth the Earth, riſing in the Eaſt, and ſhining even unto the Weſt, or from one end of Heaven to the other; (as <hi>Luke</hi> hath it) but if ſo be that ſome ſhould underſtand, this lightening, as comits, or common lightening, which is uſual in hot wether, and in times of thunder, and the like; It cannot be ſo underſtood, becauſe that ſuch lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning cometh as often out of the South and Weſt, (and ſomtimes North) as out of the Eaſt, and alſo is ſo far from being ſeen from the Eaſt, even unto the Weſt; that ſomtimes it is ſeen to be tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lightening wether in one (neighbouring) Land, and not in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; and in one County and not in another, if not in one pariſh ſomtimes and not in another; but this lightening ſhineth from the Eaſt, even to the Weſt, from one end of Heaven unto another: the which is to be underſtood, the Sun in the Firmament, which lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the earth, even from the Eaſt unto the Weſt: The Scripture diſcovering her riſing in the Eaſt, and ſhining unto the Weſt, and the glory of the Lord ſeen like unto the riſing of the Sun, that ſhineth into the Weſt, and filleth the earth with her light and glory, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.6. <hi>chap.</hi> 59.19. But let it be the Sun in the Firmament, or other lightening; yet the matter lyeth here, that Jeſus Chriſts coming is not in obſcurity, but as a light that cometh out of the Eaſt and ſhineth unto the Weſt, or ſhineth from one end of Heaven to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the ſequel of the matters is, that the Chriſt that is to be ſeen in a Deſart or ſecret Chamber, namely, in a private place, is far from being the true Chriſt; that they need not ſay, when the true Chriſt comes, let us go here or there (namely into a Deſart, or ſecret Chamber, or Mountain) to ſee him, but he ſhall be ſeen at once as the Sun that riſeth in the Eaſt, and is ſeen by all even to the Weſt, without going into Deſarts, or Chambers, or Mountains, or the like; and to this agreeth the Prophets, that ſaith, <hi>The glory of the Lord ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:119763:85"/>
and all fleſh ſhall ſee it together, for he ſhall come in the clouds, and every eye ſhall ſee him, and they that pierced him, and all the kindred ſhall waile becauſe of him.</hi> So in ſhort I underſtand, it is the perſonal coming of the Lord Jeſus, which is ſpoken of in that Text, <hi>Mat</hi> 24. and not any ſpiritual coming, for the ſame Jeſus (even the ſame bleſſed man) which did once aſcend, in like manner ſhall (again) deſcend, as I have proved in the former part of this Treatiſe, intituled, <hi>Truth and Innocency:</hi> and thus much briefly of the coming of the Lord Jeſus like lightening, which lightening, is to be ſeen from one end of Heaven to the other, even from the Eaſt unto the Weſt, which light all men that have their natural eye-ſight, do ſee at once; even ſo ſhall the perſonal appearance of Jeſus Chriſt be; that all men ſhall ſee his glory together, when he ſhall appear in the Clouds of Heaven with all his holy Angels with him; and this I am very confident was the mind of Chriſt in that place: and thus I paſs to ſpeak ſomewhat to the Carkaſs, and Eagles being gathered unto it: which is,</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the fourth and laſt thing, ſheweth the taking up of the Saints to meet Jeſus Chriſt; the Carkaſs being underſtood Chriſt, and the Eagles the Saints, its only a ſimily, ſhewing that as the Eagles ſuddenly gather themſelves tegether to the place where a Carkaſs is, even ſo the Saints ſhall ſuddenly be gathered together, to the place where Chriſt is; agreeing with, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4, 14, 15, 16. and <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.40. the which I have before ſpoken of more at large; &amp; therefore ſhall leave it at preſent with the Reader, and paſs all the other things very briefly, becauſe I find the things already ſpoken to, is the whole grounds or maſter-pieces of your Book, and thoſe things that I ſhall now ſpeak to, I ſhall take them as they lie in order in your book; and the firſt thing that I obſerve, and ſhall ſpeak to; is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Of the new pouring out of the Spirit, and a new marriage after the former,</hi> Page 5.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I find there was a Marriage between God and old Iſrael, which is a Metaphor, to wit, the enjoyment of the inheritance, and the marriage bed, (as I may ſo call it) the preſence of the Lord in Types, dwelling amongſt them in that holy Land, or glorious Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Jeruſalem, which was a Type of the heavenly Jeruſalem, and the Tabernacle of God to be with men, when they ſhall injoy the marriage bed, to wit, being preſent with Chriſt; knowing him as we are known by him; the which while we live in this Body we do not, for we are abſent from the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6.

                  <p>And as to your cited text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.1 2, 3. it is a Parrable, and its alſo clear, that the whole time of the preaching of the Goſpel, is the time of the inviting the Gheſts, and the Parrable holds not, if all the Gheſts be not invited before the day of the marriage ſupper, and I am ſure that all the Gheſts are not yet invited nor born; I could ſpeak at large unto it, but I ſtudy brevity, and ſo ſhall paſs to the next thing; which is,</p>

It's true that the Jews had ſeveral Ordinances, which were to be performed only at Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem; and hence it came to paſs, that they practiſed them not in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> and therefore they were far from being <hi>Babelliſh;</hi> but the Goſpel Ordinances are limitted to no one place more than other, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch if there were a Church in <hi>Rome,</hi> they might practiſe all Chriſts Ordinances, (if they could enjoy their Liberty ſo to do) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be the ſeat of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and yet not be blamed, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended of by the Lord, as was the Church of <hi>PARGAM<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S, Rev.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>You may find all your new ſtated Churches,</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Henden</hi>) <hi>of a different Mettal from the true, how near ſoever to the primitive they ſeem to be in the outward ſhell, and yet in reallity do ground upon another foundation, upon Believers not poſſeſſed with ſuch a power ſent down from heaven,</hi> page 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> They differ not in their Mettal; Had the primitive Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es a Command from Chriſt to preach and gather Churches? the very ſame Command have we unto the worlds end, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18, 19, 20. Had the primitive Churches gifts of Gods Spirit? ſo have the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches now, even ſo many as are uſeful for the comfortable being of the Church, although others which were more primely concerned as to Unbelievers, for to confirm the Goſpel that it might be a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rule to be obſerved and practiſed to the worlds end, did ceaſe; for ſo it was under the Law, the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was once confirmed with Signs and Wonders, but there was no ſuch thing looked for when they came out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> it was enough that it was once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed: admit of this Argument to prove Signs and Miracles now out of uſe; which is:</p>
                  <p>If Signs and Miracles ſerve not for Believers, but ſuch as believe not, to bear teſtimony to the truth of the New Teſtement of Jeſus Chriſt; then they are altogether unuſeful to us in theſe Nations, who do believe the Teſtament of Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>But Signs and Miracles was for that end, <hi>(viz.)</hi> to confirm the Truth of the New Teſtament to Unbelievers.</p>
                  <p>And therefore of no uſe in theſe Nations, where all, or the moſt part, believe it.</p>

                     <pb n="159" facs="tcp:119763:86"/>But thoſe things which are uſeful to Believers, they remain in the ſame power and efficacy; as that Ordinance of Prayer with the Sick, and annointing them with oyl, is known to be as powerful and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in our dayes as ever, and all others which conduce to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches comfortable being: I know many that can, (and will if they be called unto it) witneſs the truth of this thing; I ſpeak with much confidence, it being truth upon my knowledge: and ſo I ſhall leave this at preſent, ſuppoſing that I may have occaſion to ſpeak more of it anon, and now paſs to the next thing; which is, the four Reaſons an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to this, to ſhew the difference between the new ſtated Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, (as Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> calls them) and the primitive Church; which are,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Faith muſt foot upon a call,</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Henden</hi>) <hi>as done in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the heavenly voyce; but now there is no call for viſible Church Marriages.</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> By the ſame word that the primitive Churches practiſed Ordinances, (which was by Chriſts word and voyce) we alſo pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe them, for his word, even the ſame word, was to go into all the world, unto every creature, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18, 19, 20. And by the ſame Word every creature was to believe and practiſe the Ordinances, in order to their eternal happineſs, and therefore the ſame call; and whoſo practiſeth them from the ſame call with an honeſt heart, obeyes the heavenly voyce.</p>
                  <p>And whereas Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> ſaith, <hi>there is no call for viſible Church Marriages.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is the ſame call that was in the primitive age, for there was but only eſpouſing and making fit for the Maariage day, (which is not to be till the change of the Gentiles) and the ſame eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſing and making fit for the Marriage, we are now about, as the Apoſtles in their day was, as I before have ſhewed; and ſo I paſs to the ſecond Reaſon cited by Mr. <hi>Henden;</hi> which is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>God having promiſed to ſpirit theſe again, Faith muſt relie upon that promiſe until it be fulfilled,</hi> page 15.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That Faith muſt relie upon Gods Promiſes, as well as to act from the Command, is granted; but Chriſt hath promiſed his ſpiritual preſence alwayes, to the end of the world, in the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Ordinances; therefore they were never without the Spirit, or their ſpiritual efficacy; and as for the pouring out of the Spirit again, its not on the Gentiles, but the Jews, who now are ſhut up under unbeliefe, who at the ſecond coming of Chriſt, <hi>(viz.)</hi> his perſonall
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:119763:87"/>
coming, ſhall have the Spirit poured out upon them, (I mean the whole Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and not before) and then they ſhall be a holy people to the Lord, read <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. from the firſt <hi>verſ.</hi> to the 12. but as for the Gentiles, I never find that the Spirit is taken from them, <hi>viz.</hi> the faithful, ſince the primitive times; take heed of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding the Promiſes made to the Jews, with them made to the Gentiles, which I find to be your practiſe, which cauſeth you to ſpeak, and affirm things you know not where of; but I am ſparing to ſpeake conſidering your gravity; and ſo I paſs to the third reaſon; which is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, Profeſſion a lone</hi> (ſaith <hi>Mr.</hi> Henden) <hi>can no more give life to Ordinances, from which the glory of the Lord is departed, then it can infuſe a living ſoule into a dead Carkas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It's true, if once the Lord have left his Ordinances, Mens profeſſion cannot make them lively Oracles, but it hath been already proved, that Chriſt is ſo far from leaving them, that he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed his Preſence, in the performance of them, to the Worlds end; and what you can ſay of the departure of Gods glory, from any Ordinance, I can ſay the ſame of the Ordinance of Preaching, and Prayer, (which you ſay you own) but Gods glory is not departed from his Ordinances: and ſo I paſſe to the fourth and laſt reaſon, which is; ſay you,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This pretended Faith, void of the call, and Promiſe of God; and the vitall influence of its prims Original cauſe, is but a meer work, a bare creature Foundation, by far too week to lay a Goſpel fabrick up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This reaſon is comprehended in the former, the which cauſeth me to ſay again, that this Faith (in the practiſing of all Chriſts Ordinances) is neither void of the call, or promiſe of God; read my Reaſons, to prove their continuance before cited; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over we know, that the neglect of the practiſing of the Ordinances, although it may be before a long time, ſo as that they may be loſt, or unknown, yet if they be found written amongſt the Statutes of Jeſus Chriſt; its enough to warrant the reviving of them into their former practiſe, without a new call, witneſs the Ordinance of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Booths, being loſt for above four hundred years, even from the daies of <hi>Joſhua</hi> Son of <hi>Nun,</hi> until their coming out of the <hi>Babylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> captivity, as you may ſee, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.14, 15, 16, 17. and as to the foundation of the Goſpel fabrick, (you ſpeake of) I ſay, that the Foundation of it is already laid, and confirmed, and we only
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:119763:87"/>
(according to Gods appointment) do build thereon, and not lay a new Foundation, namely, we walk not in a new form or Fabrick of Order, but in the ſame good old Ordinances and Fabrick of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which Chriſt and the Apoſtles laid, and the primitive Churches walked in, (and we commanded to follow their ſteps) which Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Fabrick, is not only laid as a platform for us, to build upon, but its alſo already confirmed; which was the anſwer that I gave to Mr. <hi>Henden,</hi> (in our conference) ſaying, our Baptiſing was no new Baptiſing, but the old way of Baptiſing, (both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the form of it, and ſubject Baptiſed) the which was practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Lord, and the primitive Churches, and left written for us to follow their examples, and therefore wanted no new ſigns or miracles to confirm it, it being already confirmed: and that they only want new Signs and Miracles for confirmation, that walk in new waies and Ordinances, which have not as yet been confirmed, but the waies and Ordinances which we walk in, and contend for, are the ſame which have been already confirmed, as none can deny, and therefore warrantable to be practiſed by all the Lords People: and thus I leave this particular, and come to the next thing conſiderable; which is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All the Apoſtles were dead at the end of the firſt, or beginning of the ſecond Century, &amp; in a little time after, Evangiliſts and Prophets; you may from this place as well argue the conſtant abiding of Apoſtles, Prophets, and Evangeliſts, as of Paſtors and Teachers, ſeeing the Spirit here ſpeaks of a compleat, &amp; full diſpenſation of Official Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, conſiſting of all theſe together, to bring this noble work to its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> page 21.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Whereas you ſay, <hi>all the Apoſtles were dead at the end of the firſt, or the beginning of the ſecond Century.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It's a very hard matter for you to prove it, unleſs by the word <hi>ALL,</hi> you mean <hi>ALL</hi> the twelve Apoſtles, and if ſo its very like that all they might be dead by that time; but that either the Offices of Apoſtleſhip dyed then, or that all the Apoſtles which were to be to the worlds end, were then dead, that I poſſitively deny, becauſe I find, that in the time of the <hi>Roman</hi> Beaſt (or <hi>Babylonias</hi>) raign, their ſhall be Apoſtles and Prophets, who ſhall rejoyce at her down-fall, who have been perſecuted by her, <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.20. in theſe words, <hi>Rejoyce over her, thou Heavens, and ye holy APOSTLES and PROPHETS, for God hath avenged you on her.</hi> The word Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is to be underſtood the Church; and Apoſtles and Prophets, is

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> they are ſuch as ſet forth, carry, or publiſh (either with tongue or pen) the joyful (or ſweet news) or glad tydings of great joy, which is to all men; hence <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> and <hi>John</hi> who were (without all diſpute) Apoſtles, yet were called (by way of emphaſis) Evangeliſts, becauſe they publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (by way of writing) the joyful news, or glad tydings comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the life and death of the Lord Jeſus; and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> writing to <hi>Timothy,</hi> bids him <hi>do the work of an Evangeliſt, make an full proof of thy Miniſtry,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. So then an Evangeliſt I underſtand to be ſuch an one, that hath a great faculty (or more properly a gift) carrying him on to ſet forth (both with tongue and pen) the glad tydings of great joy.</p>
                  <p>Every one hath his proper gift from God, and ſome have a gift much leading them to reprove for ſin, and exhort from ſin; I do not ſay that ſuch cannot or do not preach glad tydings at any time, but ſay they may at ſome times, and yet their gift (runs out or) leads them forth moſt to reproof for ſin, and the like; and ſo it is on the other hand, ſome mens gift leads them forth to preach moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, upon comfortable things to the godly, as the joyes of ſalvation, and all ſuch glad tydings, and not reproof and terror, and the like; and I underſtand that its not the <hi>OFFICE</hi> (ſimply conſidered) which is from the Lord, but it is the gift qualifying for the <hi>OFFICE</hi> which is from the Lord, and the <hi>OFFICE</hi> it ſelf, from the Church, and the Text carryeth the gift (to quallifie for the Office) to be from God, and not the <hi>OFFICE</hi> it ſelf, as you may read, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18, in theſe words, <hi>Wherefore when he aſcended up on high</hi> he led captivity captive, <hi>and gave GIFTS to men;</hi> compared with verſ. 11.) <hi>And he gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:119763:88"/>
Evangeliſts, and ſome Paſtors, and ſome Teachers,</hi> ver. 12. <hi>For the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of the Saints for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt, until we ALL come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto the perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From whence we may learn, that all thoſe gifts ſpoken before, are for the work of the Miniſtry, and if the Miniſtry did remain in all the times of apoſtacy, (as you ſay it did) then of neceſſity thoſe gifts and offices did alſo remain; for all theſe are comprehended in the Miniſtry, and it is <hi>for the perfecting of the Saints, till we all come into the unity of the faith:</hi> now the Greek word (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) is of a very large acceptation or ſignification, as from the Lattin word <hi>CONS<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>MMATIO, a full finiſhing or atchieving the total ſum and ending of the work;</hi> from whence I underſtand, that from the word which ſaith, for the <hi>PERFECTING</hi> of the Saints <hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Is meant, that theſe gifts &amp; offices, are to remain until all the Saints, even until the laſt which is to be born and brought forth gradually into the World, is converted and united into the faith, and made a perfect man in Chriſt Jeſus; So then all theſe official gifts, are to remain, and are unſeperable in the Miniſtry, for the gathering of the Saints, and perfecting thoſe that are thereby gathered, until all be both gathered and perfected; and thus I ſhall leave this, as having more to ſay to it, but want time, and therefore paſs to the next thing; which is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Sealed number are not the natural ſeed of</hi> Abraham, (ſaith M. <hi>Henden</hi>) <hi>but Gentile Iſraelites, proved by theſe reaſons.</hi>

                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>The number Sealed from amongſt them, was the ſame, not hurt by the Locuſt,</hi> Chap. 9.4. <hi>The ſame ſtanding on Mount-Zion, which duly pondered with all circumſtances, can be reduced to no time

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The aſſertion is denyed, and hath already been diſproved, and all men that have their eyes in their head, (I mean all thoſe that have not the eyes of their underſtanding out may ſee it,) for as I have already proved, the Spirit of God doth not only call thoſe that are Sealed the Tribes of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but names every Tribe diſtinctyl, <hi>Revel.</hi> 7.4, 5, 6, 7. and when you write again, I pray you cite one Text written between the Alpha of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and the Omega of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> to prove plainly, that when God ſpeaks of the <hi>TRIBES</hi> of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and names every Tribe diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that he then means Gentiles, and then I will believe it. As for the Sealed number ſpoken of, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. are the ſame number and people; and whereas its ſaid that they were Virgins, its clear, at that time <hi>Iſrael</hi> is to be in a Virgins condition, and at that time (or ſtraight after it) they ſhall be marryed unto Chriſt, by their being put into the poſſeſſion of the covenant, or the thing covenanted; which is to be made after thoſe dayes, (ſaith <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 31.) relating to the laſt dayes even till the appearance of Jeſus, when they ſhall ſay, loe this is our God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.1. but that they are called Virgins, read <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.4, 21. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 62.5. <hi>Hoſea,</hi> and many Texts might be given to prove the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as it is conſidered in the latter dayes, to be in a Virgin condition, I mean <hi>Iſrael</hi> the ten Tribes and not <hi>Judah.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, The Scriptures is very full in ſhewing, that they are called a people redeemed from among men, where they have been ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and made to ſerve their enemies, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.10. <hi>chap.</hi> 51.11. <hi>chap.</hi> 62.12. with many more which might be added.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as for their following the Lamb, whitherſoever he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it is ſpoken in reference to the juncture of time, in which the Beaſt (or great Antichriſt) is to raign; who ſtriveth to have them believe, and follow him, but they refuſe, and will own none but Chriſt to be their King; their minds running after him, they having (before) been informed of his glory by the two Prophets, and alſo ſeen a glimps of it in the glorious ſigns of his coming in the Clouds of Heaven, with power and great glory; and ſo they are ſaid to follow him. And as for the order of the words following, I could ſpeak largely to it if I had time; but if I ſhould ſpeak of the things in particular contained in this book, with their attendance, it would
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:119763:89"/>
take up a large time, the which neceſſitates me but juſt to mention it, (as it were) and to leave it; and ſo I paſs the aſſertion, and come to the reaſons to prove the Sealed number Gentiles (cited by you;) which is,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe the book of the Revelation, was not ſent to the Jews to the Gentiles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Suppoſe it were ſo, that all the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> were Gentiles (which I think Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> will not affirm, although ſome of them might be and were Gentiles) yet this makes not at all as (I humbly conceive) to prove that the Miniſtry contained in the viſion, ſeen by <hi>John,</hi> did not appertain to the Jews, neither do I ſay, that it did wholly appertain to the Jews, ſo as not to include ſome things alſo which related to (or concerned) the Gentile Church, but if it were only ſpoken of the glory and goodneſs of God unto the Jews, yet it would have ſpoken much comfort and joy unto the Gentile Churches in their tribulation, becauſe their bleſſing and rich promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are bound up (as I may ſay) amongſt the promiſes of <hi>Iſraels</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and glory, the which is proved at large in the Scripture; but at preſent I ſhall only cite theſe two places, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.12, 13, 14, 15.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I underſtand that <hi>John</hi> (to whom the viſion was ſhewn unto) was a Jew, as I think none will deny, and I ſuppoſe that the viſion was to comfort him in his perſecuted baniſhed condition, and unleſs <hi>Johns</hi> nature was eſtranged from <hi>Pauls</hi> and the reſt of the faithful Jews, it was a thing of no ſmall comfort to him, (in his tribulation) to be ſhewn the glory of his brethren, (after the fleſh) the Jews, ſhortly to be conferred upon them. And</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it was the way of God of old, to comfort his ſervants, the Propets in their perſecution and captivity in that way; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed nothing will comfort a godly Prophet or Miniſter more than that thing, namely, for them to ſee the proſperity, and glory of the godly to approach, more eſpecially if they be related unto them in the fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1, 2, 3. and that it was the way of God to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort his Prophets that way, ſee <hi>Ezek.</hi> 40.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.1, 2, 13. And ſo I paſs this, and come to the ſecond; which is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. <hi>The main body of the viſion, was after the dayes of John,</hi> Revel. 4.1. ſaith Mr. <hi>Henden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> In this reaſon (as I think) you want an interpreter to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain your mind, that is to ſay, whether the accompliſhing of the body of the viſion were after <hi>Johns</hi> dayes, or whether the greateſt
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:119763:90"/>
part of the viſion, (ſignified by your word body) was ſhewn or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to ſome other perſon after <hi>Johns</hi> dayes; and if it was ſhewn unto another perſon, after <hi>Johns</hi> dayes, when you write again cite a Text of Scripture, to ſignifie the perſon; and Secondly, reſolve by Scripture when <hi>Johns</hi> dayes ended, becauſe the Text ſaith that he was to propheſie again before many people and Nations, and Languages, and Kings, <hi>Revel.</hi> 10.11. I would not be looked upon, as one that made it his practiſe to ask curious queſtions, becauſe you may as well ask me when the dayes of ſome other of the Apoſtles ended, and demand me to reſolve it by the Scripture, which could not very well be done, only by good reaſon drawn from Scripture; But I deſire to hear your judgment about the end of <hi>Johns</hi> dayes, becauſe it was a queſtion amongſt Chriſts own Diſciples, <hi>John</hi> 21.23.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, becauſe that the Text ſaith, expreſly of <hi>John,</hi> that he ſhould propheſie again as before ſaid, and the accompliſhment of that propheſie, is yet to be fullfiled; the which I have ſpoken of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and ſhall again if the Lord will, when I come to ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of the two Witneſſes.</p>
                  <p>But as in anſwer of the two Reaſons, I ſay, there is not ſo much as the colour of a Reaſon in it, to prove (as I conceive) that thoſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were to be underſtood <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The four Angels</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Henden</hi>) <hi>ſtood upon all quarters of the Earth, and the with-holding is univerſal, the four Winds, and the hurt thereby to all the unſealed Iſraelites; which cannot agree with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one Nation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That the Angels ſtood upon the four quarters of the Earth is true, and the with-holding of the Winds is ſo univerſal, as to hurt all places and perſons, except the Sealed number, and the places that eſcape the Antichriſt, which ſome ſhall, as is before proved; but what for all this, doth it therefore follow that the Sealed <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> were <hi>Gentiles?</hi> its no reaſon at all to me, for it is clear, that the Jews are ſcattered into the four quarters of the Earth, and it is as clear that God will gather them from thence, and will get them fame in all places, where they have been put to ſhame; and alſo it is as clear, that it is the family of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which are to be deceived (as hath been already proved, and it may alſo be further ſeen to be they that ſhall be deceived, firſt and laſt. even <hi>Gogg</hi> and <hi>Magog,</hi> as <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.8. <hi>He ſhall deceive the NATIONS</hi> (viz the family of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) <hi>which are in the four quarters of the Earth, Gogg and Magog,</hi> &amp;c. but the Elect: (<hi>viz.</hi> the Jews) ſhall not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:119763:90"/>
And whereas you ſay, the hurt is to all the unſealed <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> my anſwer is,</p>
                  <p>Shew that any of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> (at the fullfiling of this Propheſie) ſhall be unſealed, I am ſure that the Prophets, and alſo the Apoſtles ſaith, that then they ſhall all be holy unto the Lord, <hi>and all Iſrael ſhall be ſaved, as it is written;</hi> when the Lord ſhall thorowly purge away the filth of the Daughter of Zion, then although they ſeek for ſin in <hi>Judah,</hi> they ſhall find none, for they ſhall defile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves no more with any of their deteſtable things, or abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>So then in ſhort, the anſwer to the third reaſon is; that although the Angels were ſtanding on the four quarters of the Earth, holding the four Winds; and the with-holding the four Winds, were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, and the hurt to all the unſealed <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> proves not at all to my underſtanding, that the Sealed number were <hi>Gentiles,</hi> they that can receive it let them, for I do aſure you I cannot ſee not ſo much as a colour of reaſon in it: and thus I paſs to the examination of the four reaſons to prove the ſealed number, cited by Mr. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> to be <hi>Gentiles:</hi> which is ſaith he; becauſe,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This hurt was chiefly introduced by the Locuſt,</hi> Chap. 9.4. <hi>and by the Beaſt, which cannot be applyed to the Jews, but to the Chriſtian Nations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I could (if I had time) ſpeak much concerning the Locuſt and their King, and the perſons tormented, but that which I ſay at preſent, in anſwer to it is, I think that herein Mr. <hi>Headen</hi> and I am very near of one opinion in this thing, for ſaith he, <hi>the hurt was chiefly introduced by the Locuſt and Beaſt, which can in no ſenſe be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And all that I have been contending about, is, that thoſe that were not hurt were the Jews, (which were the ſealed number) and here Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> ſaith, the hurt introduced by the Locuſt and Beaſt, was unto the Nations; (I underſtand him Gentiles) for he ſaith, <hi>it cannot be applyed unto the Jews,</hi> and if the hurt cannot be applyed unto the Jews, then upon his own argument, the Jews were the ſealed number, for all others were hurt, only they that were ſealed were not to be hurt, <hi>Revel.</hi> 9.4. But by the way the hurt there, was not at all by the Beaſt, and his followers, but to the Beaſt, and his followers, by the Locuſt; and ſo I paſs this and come to the fifth reaſon; which is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By comparing the Text with chap.</hi> 11.2. <hi>we may clearly ſee,</hi>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:119763:91"/>
ſaith Mr. <hi>Henden, that the Nations poſſeſſed the Court without the Temple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true the Nations (or Gentiles) did take the outward Court before it was meaſured, (<hi>viz.</hi> Walled) and did tread the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly City under foot, for which cauſe the Lord ſent thoſe plagues on the Nations, when he had ſealed the Tribes of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which were not to be hurt by the plagues of the Locuſt, or Angels, although they were troubled, and perſecuted by the Beaſt, for which cauſe God ſent plagues upon him as he did upon <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Egypt</hi> for the caſe may be fitly paralleled with <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in <hi>Egypt,</hi> by <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and as God ſent ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral kinds of plagues on <hi>Pharaoh</hi> for his cruelty (exerciſed) againſt his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> even ſo will the Lord ſend ſeveral kinds of plagues upon the Antichriſt and his followers, the Nations, for their cruelty again the very ſame people (viz, Jews) for his love unto them is an everlaſting love, and therefore will he have compaſſion on them, and gather them, and deſtroy all their enemies according to his word; and thus I paſs this reaſon, alſo ſaying, that although it be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed that there be alligoriſe in the viſion of this book, yet it's meet that we diſtinguiſh between reaſon and madneſs, and take heed of making an alligory of that which is plainly to be underſtood, that we come not under that reproof <hi>of darkning words without knowledge,</hi> and <hi>perverting,</hi> (and <hi>wreſting</hi>) <hi>the Scriptures</hi> to our deſtruction; and thus I come to the ſixth and laſt reaſon cited by Mr. <hi>Henden,</hi> to prove that the Sealed Number were Gentiles: which is; ſaith he,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The number Sealed (from amongſt them) was the ſame not hurt by the Locuſt,</hi> chap. 9.4. <hi>nor utterly deceived by the Beaſt,</hi> chap. 13.8. Mat. 24.24. <hi>The ſame ſtanding on Mount-Zion,</hi> chap. 14.1. <hi>which duly pondered with all the circumſtances, can be reduced to no time or condition, but of that of the elect in Babylon, if the Roman and Antichriſtian defection be not decyphered by theſe figures, but the Jews only, then it is altogether omitted in this book.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Whereas it is ſaid the number ſealed was not hurt, even ſo have I ſaid already, that the Tribes of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were ſealed, to the end that they might be diſtinguiſhed from the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers of the Beaſt, that they might not be hurt, when the plagues were to be executed upon the Beaſt, and his worſhipers.</p>
                  <p>And Secondly, where you ſay, (<hi>nor utterly deceived by the Beaſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:119763:91"/>I underſtand your Judgment is, that they were deceived, although not utterly deceived; it ſeems to be a kind of a curious diſtinction, (the word <hi>nor utterly deceived by the Beaſt</hi>) ſuch an one as I find not made by Chriſt, either in <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. or <hi>Revel.</hi> 9. for ſaith Chriſt, <hi>they ſhall deceive if it were poſſible the very elect;</hi> implying, that it was impoſſible to decive them. And,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, whereas it is ſaid, <hi>the ſame ſealed ones, ſtanding upon Mount-Zion, can be reduced unto no time or condition, but the Elect in Babylon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is a ſtrange alligory indeed to reduce Mount-Zion to Babylon, or that Babylon is ſet forth by Mount-Zion, I pray when you write again cite one text that calls Babylon (by the name) Mount-Zion; Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> ſeems to reprove Mr. <hi>Elmeſtone</hi> (in his 33. <hi>pag.</hi>) for calling Babylon (by way of argument) Zion, and yet in his 29. <hi>pag.</hi> he calls Mount-Zion Babylon himſelf; ſo that I may take up St. <hi>Pauls</hi> words, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.22. which ſaith, <hi>Thou that abhorreſt Idols, doſt thou commit ſacriledge?</hi> but I paſs to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, which is; ſaith Mr. <hi>Henden,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If the Romiſh and Antichriſtian defection be not decyphered by theſe figures, but the Jews only, then it is altogether omitted in this book, then muſt all from thence to the end of the Revelations be peculiar to the Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe figures do not decypher the defection of the Romiſh Babylon, and yet both her defection and judgment was ſhewn unto <hi>John,</hi> as in <hi>Revel.</hi> 17. &amp; <hi>chap.</hi> 18. and alſo ſomewhat ſhewn as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of it, <hi>chap.</hi> 1.5. &amp; <hi>chap.</hi> 6. but theſe things would be too large to ſpeak to in particular at preſent, conſidering my time is ſhort, I may have time to open theſe things more at large hereafter, but at preſent I ſay in a few words, that both the viſion of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and alſo of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> ſpeaks more properly of the change of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical Governours and Governments of the World, than the defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a Church, to wit the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> for the fourth king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome upon earth, which was the <hi>Roman</hi> kingdome, was begun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the viſion was ſhewn unto <hi>John,</hi> yea before Chriſt ſuffered, for he ſuffered under the <hi>Roman</hi> power, and therefore he ſpeaks not much of that; and the defection of a Church or falſe worſhippers, and the people of God ſuffering under them, is no ſtrange thing, and therefore not ſo obſerveable, when we conſider how frequent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtates and falſe worſhippers are in this world; and for a Church to change its government into ſtates pollicy, is no great thing to be
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:119763:92"/>
noted in Scripture, but the alteration of Monarchical Government, and Governors is of great note in the Propheſie of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and alſo in the book of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> becauſe they are the things that ſhew forth the government of the great King Jeſus upon Earth, whoſe Kingdome ſhall break in pieces all other Kingdomes; when their Kingdom cometh into the hands of the eight, who alſo is of the ſeventh, the which I have ſhewn how it is, (although in differing phraſes) before the which time and things approacheth very near, for we doutleſs live in the latter end of the fourth Kingdom (<hi>viz.</hi> the Roman Kingdome) in the time of the feet and toes which was part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Iron and partly Clay, which holds not together in its mixture, which is the Cauſe of the great ſtir and ſtrivings in our Nations, and other places in the World at this day, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.31, 32. to the 45. But I leave this and the reaſons cited by Mr. <hi>Henden,</hi> to prove that the Sealed number were Gentiles, and leave the ſerious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to peruſe, <hi>Revel.</hi> 7.4, 5, 6, 7, 8. which will better inform them who the Sealed number is; and thus I paſs to the next thing conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; which is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The beſt of Saints</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Henden</hi>) <hi>are not yet come to that height of righteouſneſs requirable, in a Goſpel order, in point of love and mutual fellowſhip,</hi> page 70.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I had thought that you had ſaid before (in <hi>page</hi> 2.) that their ſpiritual union and charity, and all moral Precepts did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main according to their primitive inſtitution, and were not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the Beaſt in all the times of apoſtacy; and now to ſay, that the ſealed elect number, had loſt their righteouſneſs in point of love, &amp; mutual fellowſhip; is to ſay, that the ſealed elect number, that were not hurt (as you ſay) were ſo hurt as they had not only their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward order corrupted, but were alſo ſo corrupted within, that the notable, and <hi>theological</hi> grace of love, and mutual fellowſhip, was ſo defaced, as they not fit to meddle with outward Ordinances; and if they were not fit to meddle with them, how were they fit to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle (as I may ſay) with God in that Ordinance of Prayer, and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and how could ſuch eat the Lords Supper, (which ſignifieth mutual love and fellowſhip, the which Ordinance you ſay was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable and to be practiſed in all the times of apoſtacy,) and would not their defection in that point, as well diſable them from being an elect number, as well as from outward Ordinances (when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider all other graces, without that grace of love is nothing) when they had loſt that grace of love, or ſo defaced in it, as not fit
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:119763:92"/>
for the out-ſide of things (I mean the outward Ordinances which you ſpeak of) how then could they be fit for God and ſpiritual wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip? I know not; mend it when you write again, and when you have done all that you can do to it, there will appear in my judgment more confuſion &amp; contradiction in it than good reaſon, but I leave it at preſent, and ſhall ſpeak ſomewhat to your ſixth Reaſon, againſt conſtituting (as you call it) of Churches in our times; which is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A further reaſon of the unwarrantableneſs of Church conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in our times, is the diviſions &amp; rents amongſt the godly,</hi> page 72.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The diviſions amongſt the godly, is acknowledged not to be their ſtrength but weakneſs, not their vertue but (rather) their vice, yet notwithſtanding it may be, and is a time now for the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of Saints, and conſtituting them into congregations in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Goſpel (for ſo we underſtand the word Church to be a congregation) for there was diviſions in the primitive time amongſt the Churches, and alſo amongſt the Apoſtles, ſo as that St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> rent or divided one from another; and alſo there was great contentions amongſt the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and the <hi>Philipians,</hi> and others, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.39. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 1. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.16. which was not their vertue as before ſaid: and there are a people in our dayes, even in our Nation (I may ſay and ſpeak ſafely) conſiſting of thouſands that are one in the faith, fellowſhip, and order of the Goſpel, &amp; many more are coming onwards, according to their ſeveral abilities in the knowledge of God; &amp; although there be ſome that are weak amongſt profeſſors, yet that may not hinder thoſe that are ſtrong and able, to work in their building of a houſe for the Lord; but I paſs theſe things, and come to the next and laſt Objection; which is, to prove a ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without Church ſtating, cited by Mr. <hi>Henden;</hi> which is, ſaith he,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This return from myſtical Babylon, is not fully accompliſhed at one time, but is traced by diſtinct ſteps and degrees.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> You would have done well to have ſhewn the ſteps, that (is to ſay) how many there be, and what time they require to be trod, that we may know when we be at the journeyes end; ſurely its a long journey, for you have been almoſt ten years already in your journey, for now its almoſt 1660. and the fullfiling of the time of the captivity ended (as you ſay) in the year 1650. was <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſo long coming out of <hi>Babylon</hi> in <hi>Caldea</hi> trow? I think not; but in ſhort take this, that <hi>Iſrael</hi> might not neglect their building, but go on with all ſpeed that might be, ſo ſoon as they were ſet at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty from the hands of their enemies; even ſo, it is our duty to be
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:119763:93"/>
imployed about the work of God in his Church, ſo ſoon as we be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the hands of our enemies, yea while the enemy is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging againſt us, as he was againſt our brethren before us, who kept ſtedfaſt in the practiſing of all Chriſts Ordinances; even ſo ought we to do: finally, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when he went away, did give forth his laſt will and Teſtament in much plainneſs, the which he commanded to be obſerved by every creature unto the Worlds end, and did aſcend up on high, and gave gifts <hi>[i. e.]</hi> (the gifts of Miniſtry, containing, <hi>Apoſtles, Prophets, Evangeliſts, Paſtors,</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi>) to that end, that his Laws and Statutes might be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and Saints gathered and eſtabliſhed, until the laſt Saint which is to be born in the World, is united into the faith of Jeſus, and made perfect therein; to the end, that God may be glorified in his Church, in or thorow all ages even to the Worlds end: and if the breach of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, was ſo hainous in the ſight of God, much more will the breach of Chriſts Laws be unto him; therefore take heed of breaking one of the leaſt of Chriſts Commands, and teaching men ſo to do: and courteous Reader, be well adviſed what thou doſt in the neglect or breach of any of Chriſts commands, before thou doſt it, and let him that perſwades thee to it, give thee as plain Texts of Scripture to prove the ceſſation of them, as Chriſt hath given thee for the continuance of the practiſing of them; for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that when once the Teſtament is confirmed, no man muſt add or diſanul; and to ſuppoſe that Chriſt would give forth his mind in plain words at length, and forbid the continuance of them in a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, which may be changed from (1-1-0-0-0.) one to ten, or to a hundred, or a thouſand, or ſeven thouſand, or what men pleaſe, yea any thing that men will have it to be; my meaning in plainneſs is this, as for thoſe figures (brought by Mr. <hi>Henden</hi>) to prove the ceſſation of ſome of Chriſt Ordinances, have been ſpoken to or open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by many, and ſome have applyed them one way, and ſome ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they are ſo dark and myſterious, as beyond the reach of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry godly ſoul to underſtand, inſomuch that if they do neglect the practiſing of Chriſts Ordinances, from thoſe dark places, it muſt not be from their own underſtanding, but becauſe Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> openeth it, and applyeth it ſo; and if this be a good ground for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to make void the ſtatutes of Chriſt, which he hath confirmed with his own blood, together with mighty deeds of the Holy Ghoſt ſent down from Heaven; I ſhall leave the ſerious Reader to Judge, and ſhall wind up all with theſe words of our bleſſed Saviour, which
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:119763:93"/>
ſaid to his Apoſtles, <hi>Teach them</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> every creature or all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) <hi>to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you, and loe I am with you alwayes even unto the end of the World, Amen.</hi> Mat. 28.20. Mark 16.15, 16: And having thus done, in the next place I ſhall ſpeak ſomewhat briefly, as touching the conference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned; but the main things have been ſpoken to already, they being the ſame in ſubſtance with the things in his book, the which I have already anſwered, and therefore ſhall ſpeak very little to it, the firſt thing in order was,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Ordinances</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Henden</hi>) <hi>were footed or founded upon an unerring ſpirit, &amp; ſhew the man that hath the ſame ſpirit to prove his ſucceſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The anſwer was given, that the Ordinances now practiſed was no new Ordinances, but the ſame which was footed upon the unerring ſpirit, and to remain by the ſame old appointment of Chriſt, until the worlds end; this was the ſubſtance, although I gave it in more words, which time fails me to ſpeak of in particular at preſent.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>This man</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Henden</hi>) <hi>would lead you all in the dark about Baptiſme, by what authority he takes up his Baptiſme, is from</hi> Mat. 28. <hi>the which being truly read according to the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, is, Go teach all Nations, and baptiſe them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And loe I am with you to the end of the world; that is, to the end of that age; which further appears, that there was to be a ſink, or ceſſation for a time,</hi> Revel. 10.8. <hi>The words again denotes a new work of Propheſie; ſo Baptiſme doth denote to a particular time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The time of ſpeaking at both hands, was ſo long, that as I have ſaid, I cannot give you an account of the particulars of things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as there was ſpeaking long, even ſo the anſwer was long; the anſwer in ſhort, is the ſame in ſubſtance with the former, that I could not lead men in the dark, in the buſineſs of Baptiſme, becauſe it was the ſame that Chriſt practiſed and appointed, and left in his laſt will and teſtament to be practiſed to the worlds end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the worlds end</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Henden</hi>) <hi>is to be underſtood the end of that age.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which then was oppoſed, becauſe upon that conſequence, prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching was as well to ceaſe in the end of that age, as Baptiſme: But however Mr. <hi>Hendens</hi> judgement was altered, he contends in his Book for the continuance of Baptiſme, in all the times of Apoſtacy, &amp; as to the Text, <hi>Revel.</hi> 10.8. from the word <hi>AGAIN, thou muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie AGAIN,</hi> the meaning of it was, that although <hi>John</hi> was then
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:119763:94"/>
baniſhed into the vail of <hi>Patmoſe,</hi> from the faces of men, yet he was to propheſie again before Kings, Rulers, and ſo forth; not alluding at all to a ſink of the Miniſtry or Ordinances for a time, as Mr. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> ſaid: he alſo pleaded for Infant Baptiſme, urging ſome old thredbare Arguments, which is not worth ſpeaking to, and railed at me for denying the Covenant, although I ſpake nothing of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to move him thereunto; but my anſwer in ſhort was, that I was ſo far from denying the Covenant, that I did believe that there was two Covenants made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> as I long before that time had publiſhed in print.</p>
                  <p>But ſaid Mr. <hi>John Henden, Your power is not derived from the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive, becauſe you do not make the ſame manifeſtations,</hi> Mark 16.17. <hi>Theſe Signs ſhall follow them that believe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was anſwered, that if theſe Signs muſt follow in his ſenſe, or elſe the thing it ſelf falſe, for want of that viſible demonſtration, then Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> was a falſe Miniſter; and alſo by the ſame conſequence, there is never a true Believer upon earth, and then no ſalvation; for the Signs were to follow ſuch as did believe: But as I have before proved, Signs were for confirmation, and the Goſpel being once confirmed, there is no ſuch uſe of them: as the Law of old being once confirmed with Miracles, need no new Sign to confirm it again, when Iſrael came out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> nor after the Book of the Law was loſt, and found again, in the dayes of <hi>Joſia;</hi> no more need we any Sign to confirm that which is already confirmed; and alſo we know, that <hi>John</hi> did no Miracle, and yet was an approved Adminiſtrator.</p>
                  <p>Again, whereas Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> ſaid, <hi>that he was a legal Miniſter, and a Miniſter of condemnation, which had no viſible demonſtration from the ſpirit,</hi> (viz. Miracle.)</p>
                  <p>The anſwer was then, Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> was a legal one, and a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of condemnation, becauſe he profeſſeth himſelf to be a Miniſter and yet never work a Miracle, that ever I heard of; there was much time ſpent upon a kind of running diſcourſe, to little edification; for that which I would have had done in order to the legal managing of the diſcourſe, was that there ſhould have been one queſtion ſtated at a time, and that managed; but when one began, he ſpoke of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things, and ſo confounded one with another, and cleared it not as it ſhould be; I could repeat what was ſaid about the four Winds, and what was ſaid by Captain <hi>Tucker,</hi> as to the grounding of faith upon the obſcure and dark Propheſies, which was well minded, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not well weighed by our Antagoniſt, and as I think as little
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:119763:94"/>
underſtood; I have found it a ſure maxime that the greateſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence amongſt men, hath the leaſt reaſon to warrant it; which is ſad.</p>
                  <p>And whereas <hi>Hebrews</hi> 12. was brought together with <hi>Galatians</hi> 4. to prove the Church to be called Mount-Zion, neither of the places proveth it; the Apoſtle to the <hi>Galatians</hi> tels us, that it is the Covenant which is called <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is from above, and from the <hi>Hebrews</hi> we learn alſo, that it is the Covenant, or the thing Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanted: and whereas he ſaith, that we are come to Mount-Zion, he alſo ſaith, that we are come to an innumerable company of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; and to God the Judge of all things, and the Spirits of juſt men made perfect; ſo that we are come to one as well as to another, and to neither of them but by faith in the Covenant, <hi>for while we are at home in the body, we are abſent from the Lord; for we walk by faith and not by ſight.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> doth not ſay to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> that ye are Mount-Zion or Jeruſalem, but <hi>Jeruſalem which is from above, is the Mother of us all;</hi> ſo then, it was the Church which was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Jeruſalem, but Jeruſalem from above, was the Churches Mother; (mark a difference between the Children and the Mother) and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> doth not call the Church of the <hi>Hebrews</hi> Mount-Zion, but tels them that they were come to Mount-Zion, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Covenant of Mount-Zion, and the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Jeruſalem;) but I ſhall leave theſe things at preſent and paſs to the Anſwer of ſome Objections uſually urged againſt the perpetua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſts Ordinances, or the conſtant practiſing of them; and the firſt that I ſhall ſpeak to is,</p>
                  <p>Object. 1. <hi>There was a time when God did appear in his Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which ſhewed there was the power of the Spirit went along with them, as</hi> Peter <hi>in his Miniſtry, in converting three thouſand ſouls at one Sermon</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>John Henden</hi>) <hi>but now we ſee not the ſame effects, therefore the cauſe ceaſeth, God hath left them, and they are become as a dead carkaſs without a ſoul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is very true, there was a time when there was ſuch need of a viſible demonſtration of Gods Spirit to go along with his Ordinances, to bear witneſs to the ſons of men, that they were the Ordinances that were approved of by the Lord; that they might be a pattern, or platform for all men to walk in to the Worlds end: and hence it was, that when God gave to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the reſt of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the pattern of the adminiſtration of the Law, he gave it with the viſible demonſtration of his own preſence, with
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:119763:95"/>
thundrings and lightenings, and the Mountain ſmoaking with a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible maifeſtation of Gods glory, with and upon <hi>Moſes;</hi> ſo that his face did ſo ſhine with the Glory of God (when he came from the Mount) that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> could not ſtedfaſtly behold him, by reaſon of the brightneſs of the Glory of God ſhining upon him; &amp; this was his appearance when he came down with the Tables of the Law, written by God, ſo gloriouſly did God appear in the giving forth of it; but afterwards, all that the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were to do, was to have the words of the Law read to them, and they to do it, (or keep it) and not to ſay, who ſhall aſcend up into Heaven, for ſome viſible demonſtration? <hi>but the Law is nigh thee in thy mouth and in thy heart, that thou maiſt do it,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 30.10, 11, 12. even ſo ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 10.6, 7. <hi>The righteouſneſs of faith ſpeaks on this wiſe ſay not in thy heart, who ſhall aſcend up into Heaven, to fetch Chriſt down from above,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but what ſaith it? the word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart.</hi> So that true faith giveth heed to Gods word, and looks not for miracles; for ſo ſaith Chriſt, <hi>bleſſed is he that hath not ſeen and yet believed, for a ſinful, and an adulterous generation ſeek a ſign, but none ſhall be given unto them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If no Ordinance may be an approved Ordinance of God, but ſuch an one as hath a viſible manifeſtation, according to Mr. <hi>Hendens</hi> ſenſe, (as aforeſaid) then he himſelf never met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; ſo as God did approve of it, becauſe we find that when the Diſciples met together, the houſe ſpoke where they were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, his Ordinance of preaching hath not the Spirit with it, becauſe inſtead of converting three thouſand at one Sermon (I ſuppoſe) he never converted three hundred in his life, nor ſcarce half half ſo many; and as for the Ordinance of Prayer, I never heard any (of thoſe that uſually hear Mr. <hi>Henden</hi>) ſay that he hath pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till the place hath ſpoke where he was praying, as it did when the Diſciples were a Praying, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.31. and as for the Ordinance of Preaching and praying, and the like, Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> ſaith, he owns to continue in all ages uncorrupted, and they had once as great a viſible manifeſtation as any Ordinance that I know of, and yet there is no more appearance in a viſible manifeſtation in them now, than there is in any other Ordinance which Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> cryeth down; and I may fitly ſay, to Mr. <hi>Henden,</hi> as Chriſt ſaid to the Scribes and Phariſies, which did much dote upon ſigns and miracles, that <hi>the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:119763:95"/>
Kingdome of Heaven cometh not with Obſervations, as</hi> gadding after miracles, <hi>ſaying, loe here or loe there, for the Kingdome of God is within you;</hi> that is as if he ſhould have ſaid, it conſiſts more in inward glory, than outward glory or manifeſtation, for the Kings daughter is all glorious within; and the proper work of the Spirit is within, as Chriſt tels <hi>Nichodemus,</hi> ſo then the glory of Chriſts Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts more in inward gifts and graces, than in outward ſhew, but for the truth ſake that it might remain undenyable in all ages; God (in the firſt of their being divulged) granted ſigns and miracles to bear witneſs to the truth of them, and to confirm them that they might remain unqueſtionably practicable to the Worlds end, by all the Lords people; and ſo I paſs unto the ſecond Objection; which is,</p>
                  <p>Object. 2. <hi>We find that the people of God laid aſide their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring Veſſels, and many of their Ordinances, all the while they remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in</hi> Babylon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> There are two things conſiderable by way of anſwer, and the weakeſt ſtrong enough to give ſatisfaction to any reaſonable man; the firſt is, God in the old Covenant tyed his people to a place of worſhip, (<hi>viz.</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.5. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.12. <hi>John</hi> 4.20.) and therefore they ought not to meddle with ſome of their Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at any other place whatſoever, the which if they had, it would have been an abomination unto the Lord; but it is not ſo with us, as I have before proved, that if we be in <hi>Babylon,</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> or any place elſe, even where Satans ſeat is, we may and ought to hold faſt the Ordinances and practiſe them, they being limited unto no one place, for ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Whereſoever two or three are gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in my name, there will I be preſent;</hi> but if <hi>Iſrael</hi> did but pray in <hi>Babylon,</hi> it muſt be with their face toward <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> implying that Gods preſence was only there; therefore our condition and theirs, is not to be compared together.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we are not in <hi>Babylon,</hi> but in our native country, and have liberty as at this day thorow grace, and therefore we may and ought to practiſe all Chriſts Ordinances; and as for the Babel (<hi>viz.</hi> confuſion you ſpeak of) they only are in, and their eyes put out with the ſmoak of it, or at the leaſt ſadly darkned, that cannot ſee all Chriſts Ordinances which he left (in order to the well being of his Church) practicable and to be practiſed by Gods people in our dayes; and ſo I paſs to the next Objection; which is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="178" facs="tcp:119763:96"/>Object. 3. <hi>Although it be ſo, that</hi> Iſrael <hi>might not practiſe ſome of their Ordinances at any other place ſave at Jeruſalem, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> (you ſay) <hi>they practiſed them not in</hi> Babylon; <hi>but what ſay you to that Ordinance of Circumciſion which was not limited to one place, and yet we know that the Ordinance of Circumciſion was not practiſed for forty years together in the Wilderneſs, and where were they reproved for their neglect?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> neglected the Ordinance of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Wilderneſs, is true, but whether it were approved of by God, or their ſin, their lyeth the queſtion; that they might and ſhould have circumciſed them in the Wilderneſs, is clear; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that it was their ſin (rebelling againſt Gods commandement) is as clear, for as God ſought to ſlay <hi>Moſes</hi> for the neglect of the circumciſion of his Son, (which cauſed <hi>Zipporah</hi> to take a ſharp ſtone and do it, <hi>Ezod.</hi> 4.24, 25.) even ſo God did deſtroy the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> in the Wilderneſs for their rebellion againſt his commands, (that and others) that they never came into the promiſed Land; and thirdly, it is as clear, that the Lord took not away the reproach of <hi>Egypt</hi> from off the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> all the while they were in the Wilderneſs, until they fell again into the practiſe of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as you may read, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5.5, 6, 7, 8, 9. which ſaith, <hi>All the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that were born in the Wilderneſs by the way as they came forth out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>them they had not circumciſed, for the Children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>walked forty years in the Wilderneſs, till all the men of war were conſumed, becauſe they obeyed not the voyce of the Lord; and their Children whom he</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> God) <hi>raiſed up in their ſtead, them</hi> Joſhua <hi>circumciſed; for they were uncircumciſed becauſe they had not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed them by the way: and it came to paſs that when they had done circumciſing all the people that they abode in their places in the Camp, till they were whole, and the Lord ſaid unto</hi> Joſhua, <hi>THIS DAY HAVE I RO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LED AWAY THE REPROACH OF EGYPT FROM YO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>, wherefore the name of the place is called GILGAL;</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the rouling) until this day; ſo then ſuch as will neglect the Ordinances of Chriſt, may expect <hi>Iſraels</hi> reward, yea a far ſorer puniſhment; for who ſo heareth and obeyeth not Chriſt in all things whatſoever he hath left to be practiſed, ſhall be cut off from among his people, <hi>Acts</hi> 3. And ſo I paſs to the next Objection; which is,</p>
                  <p>Object. 4. Fourthly and Laſtly, <hi>If Ordinances were practicable in all ages, yet there muſt be a line of ſucceſſion; but you cannot prove
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:119763:96"/>
your ſucceſſion, for your praciſe is but a new practiſe in this Nation, therefore ſhew your admiſtrator, and the line from whence it ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly runneth, and you will ſay ſomewhat to the purpoſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Suppoſe that the perſon which Baptized me, had been a perſon not Baptized himſelf, it being a caſe of neceſſity, if he had been one which owned the truth, and found none inlightened, and in the practiſe of the ſame truth, would that have nullified the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, if it had been done by an unbaptized perſon; if ſo, who Baptized <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, who was a great Baptizer approved of by God, who did no miracle, neither was he Baptized firſt himſelf, &amp; yet he made and Baptized many Diſciples, yea he Baptized Chriſt himſelf? they are the only true ſucceſſors to Baptiſme, both to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it and adminiſter it, who have faith towards God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; as <hi>John</hi> who was not Baptized, and yet was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to Baptiſe by the Lord, as I think none will deny; and if ſo, all Scripture is given for our learning, and we may learn from that, that God did own the Baptiſme performed by a perſon unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized; we have alſo read what <hi>David</hi> did upon caſe of neceſſity, that he entered into the Houſe of God, &amp; did eat ſhew-bread, which was unlawful for any man to do ſave the Prieſts only; and alſo we have read, that when the Ordinance of Circumciſion was neglected by <hi>Moſes,</hi> who ſhould have circumciſed his Son, that <hi>Zipporah</hi> did it, and yet ſhe not blamed; and alſo although the feaſt of Booths had been neglected four hundred years (as I have before ſhewed) yet when it was found written in the Law, they never queſtioned the ſucceſſion of it, or ſome miraculous man to raiſe it (or ſet it on foot) again, but practiſed it as they <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ound it written in the Law of <hi>Moſes, Nehem.</hi> 8. But in ſhort thus; I neither find that God hath tyed us up to a line of ſucceſſion in the receiving of our Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, nor rejecting that Baptiſme that is performed by an unbapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed perſon, if he be a holy faithful man, if it be a caſe of neceſſity; the which if God hath either tyed us up as aforeſaid, or rejected a Baptiſme ſo performed, ſhew it, if it cannot be ſhewn to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, then the practiſe before mentioned is warrantable: and as for a ſucceſſion in your ſenſe, I have formerly ſhewn in conference; that the ſucceſſion of my Baptiſme, as it came from beyond Sea, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed by one Doctor <hi>Caſſol,</hi> even ſo if reports be true, there hath been a ſucceſſion from the primitive Church; I think the Church of <hi>Smarnah</hi> if I be not miſtaken, it was a conſiderable time ſince I was informed of it, and had no thoughts then to make uſe of it, neither

is it in my underſtanding material, but as to that, its like that the ancient Churches in the low Countries, can give a better account of it; but what I have before ſaid is ſufficient to ſet a foot Chriſts Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances if they had been totally loſt; namely, a call from Chriſt in his word, and from his Spirit in the heart and conſcience, ſaying, <hi>Go preach and make Diſciples, and Baptiſe them,</hi> (that are made Diſciples) <hi>and loe, I am with you alwayes to the end of the World;</hi> ſo that I ſhould conclude, that if God had called me, and appointed me to do the greater work, namely, to preach ſo as to convert ſouls, he had as well approved of me to have done the leſſer work, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Baptiſe, conſidering that they are knit together, ſo that he that may do one, may alſo do the other; admit of this argument, (its the very ſame that I gave to Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> at my firſt time of conference with him, and was never yet anſwered) which; is,</p>
                  <p>If Chriſt have joyned Preaching and Baptizing together as unſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable companions unto the Worlds end, then that perſon is not of God that ſeperates it; <hi>(Which practiſeth one and not the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>)</hi>

                  <p>But Chriſt hath joyned Preaching and Baptizing together as unſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable companions unto the Worlds end.</p>

                  <p>If thoſe whom Chriſt hath gifted and authorized to preach, he hath alſo authorized to Baptiſe, then Baptizing depends upon the gifts and authority of Chriſt given forth, and not upon a line of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</p>

to the Worlds end; read the Laſt Will and Teſtament of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18, 19, 20. So then here lyeth the authority for Baptizing in our age, and all ages; and in this runneth the line of ſucceſſion; namely, the faithful believer gifted from God to Preach and convert ſouls, is the true blood, (as by way of alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I may call it) unto whom the line of ſucceſſion runs, or the line of ſucceſſion runs in (or to) that race; and ſo I ſhall leave this Objection, and its particular attendances, and come to ſhew my opinion of the travailing Woman, and the Man-child, and of his being caught up to God, and to his Throne, and of the Womans flight into the Wilderneſs, and into what Wilderneſs, and how long ſhe ſhall abide there; and of the remnant of her ſeed perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and by who, and of the two Witneſſes propheſying, who they be, and the place, and time how long; and ſuch like things that are its attendance, I ſhall ſpeak to in their particular order, as God ſhall aſſiſt me; and ſo come to ſpeak to the firſt thing conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; which is,</p>
                  <p>As touching this travailing Woman, many have given their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, but the moſt part have built upon the Judgment of ancient Expoſitors, I do not ſpeak by way of comtempt of them, but do conclude that they were induſtrious in their day, in the which time the viſion of the Book ſpake more darkly, but towards the end, it is to ſpeak more plainly; and that which hath begot the monſter (brought forth in our times) is the turning thoſe Scriptures into alligories, which are none, which hath been the practiſe of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Miniſter, and alſo others, to make up their matter have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded Law and Goſpel together, and propheſies which peculiarly belong unto the natural ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> (as ſuch) and applyed them to the Gentiles, that it is come to ſuch a monſter (in birth) in our dayes, that perſons make an alligory of God, and have ſaid that he is the fire and candle, and every thing which hath any light in it, becauſe the Scripture ſaith, God is light (I ſpeak this of thoſe that I know my ſelf by my own knowledg) and others have affirmed, that Mount-Zion, and the new Jeruſalem, and <hi>Adam,</hi> and Chriſt, and all is within them; and in a few words I ſay, that the alligori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the Scriptures, hath been a means to make ſo many opinions as there is amongſt us: I am a thinking how ſtrangely our generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would have alligorized the words of the Prophets, concerning Chriſts riding to Jeruſalem upon a Coult, the foal of an Aſs; and of the ſmiting the Judge of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and of the thirty pieces of ſilver,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:119763:98"/>
and giving him vinegar to drink; and many ſuch like things, which the Prophets propheſied concerning Chriſt, and his ſufferings, which was fulfilled according to the letter of the word; the which the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of men in our dayes, would have made ſtrange ſtories up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, as they do upon things which is as litteral and plain, and to be fulfilled according to the letter of the word; I ſpeak theſe things to that end that we may believe that King Jeſus ſhall come and raign upon the Throne of <hi>David</hi> in Zion, according to the letter of the word; and that the Prophets that ſpeak concerning <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> their words ſhall be fulfilled; but I paſs this interpoſed diſcourſe, and come to ſpeak to the travailing Woman, who ſhe is, &amp; who is the man-child, &amp;c. and theſe things briefly.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Woman I underſtand to be Zion, namely, the two Tribes, <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Thirdly, I underſtand the remnant of her ſeed was a ſmall part that were left of the other ten Tribes, when <hi>Samariah</hi> was ſurprized and taken in the dayes of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> by <hi>Salmonazer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The taking up the Man-child to God, and to his Throne, is the taking up of the Gentile Church, which ſhall be firſt taken, and the other left behind.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The Wilderneſs ſpoken of, into which the Woman is to flie, I underſtand to be the Wilderneſs of <hi>Moab.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sixthly, The time of her abode in the Wilderneſs, is three years &amp; a half.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, The people to whom the two Witneſſes ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, is the ſmall number of the ten Tribes, then in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>

Tribes which was called the Church of Judah; and firſt, that Zion is to be underſtood the two Tribes, even <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> which <hi>Jeremiah</hi> propheſied unto, (which was carried into <hi>Babylon</hi>) ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in his <hi>Lamentations,</hi> chap. 1.17. in theſe words, <hi>Zion ſpread forth her hands, and there was none to comfort her:</hi> ſhe is called Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more than ten times over, and ſhe, (to wit, <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi>) bears the name Zion in reſpect of her place and City, that God had placed her in, which is called Zion the City of <hi>David</hi> at large in the Scripture, and I think none will deny it, which makes me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear citing the Scripture: And that this alſo in the <hi>Lamentations,</hi> is ſo plainly ſpoken of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> called by the name Zion, that I think none can deny it; &amp; that they which went into captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and are called Zion, (read <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.3, 4, 6, 8, 17. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.10.) are to be underſtood <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> read <hi>Ezra</hi> 4.1. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.3. is alſo as plain; ſo then where the Prophets ſpeaks of Zion, they mean either the City Zion, which was a Moun<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> in Jeruſalem, which <hi>David</hi> made his ſeat, (which was ſo called) or otherwiſe it is to be underſtood the worſhippers of God, (or people in that place) namely, <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> as aforeſaid: and now having premiſed theſe things, I come to prove, that this travelling Woman, is this Zion or Jeruſalem, (<hi>viz. Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> the two Tribes, for ſo I would be underſtood when I ſpeak of Zion) and that ſhe is the Woman which is to travail, and afterwards to flie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Wilderneſs, read <hi>Micah</hi> 4.7, 8, 9, 10. in theſe words, <hi>I will make HER that HALTETH a Remnant, and HER that WAS CAST OFF a ſtrong Nation, and the Lord ſhall raign over them in MO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NT ZION, from henceforth and for ever. And thou, O Tower of the flock, the ſtrong hold of the Daughter of ZION, unto thee ſhall it come, even the firſt dominion, the KINGDOME SHAL COME TO THE DA<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>GHTER OF JER<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SALEM. Now why doſt thou cry out aloud? is there no King in thee? is thy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors periſhed? for pangs have taken thee as a Woman in travail. Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion, like a Woman in travail; for now thou ſhalt go forth out of the City, and thou ſhalt dwell in the field, and thou ſhalt go even unto Babylon, there ſhalt thou be delivered, there the Lord ſhall redeem thee from the hands of thy enemies.</hi> From theſe words we may underſtand, that the Woman ſpoken of, which was to travail and bring forth, was the two Tribes, as from theſe words, <hi>for pains have taken hold on THEE as on a Woman in travail:</hi> (Who THEE?) even THEE Judah,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:119763:99"/>
(which <hi>halted</hi>) pains hath taken hold of THEE: Why ſo? Becauſe <hi>there is no King in Thee, and thy Counſellors are periſhed;</hi> yet ſhall the firſt <hi>dominions come unto the daughter JER<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SALEM:</hi> ſo then that theſe people which are called Zion and Jeruſalem in this Text, is clearly to be underſtood the two Tribes; for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe ſhe is called, <hi>her that halted, and her that was caſt off;</hi> which is uſually to be underſtood the Jews, and not the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, which is not called a People halting or caſt off.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe it is called (by name) <hi>ZION</hi> and <hi>JER<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SALEM,</hi> which the Gentiles were not, it's a name proper to the Jews, even the two Tribes, and not to the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Becauſe the Text ſaith, that <hi>then ſhall the Law go forth of ZION, and the word of the Lord from JER<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SALEM,</hi> rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the time of the fulfilling of the Prophets, when the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ſhall raign upon the Throne of his Father <hi>David,</hi> over the Houſe of <hi>Jacob,</hi> namely, the Jews, to eſtabliſh, order, and govern it in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, from henceforth and for ever.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It further appears, that the travelling Woman is the Jews, read <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.3, 4, 5, 6. in theſe words, <hi>For loe the day cometh ſaith the Lord, that I will bring again the captivity of my people Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael and Judah, ſaith the Lord; and I will cauſe them to return to the Land that I gave their Fathers, and they ſhall poſſeſs it: And theſe were the words that the Lord ſpake concerning Iſrael, and concerning Judah; for thus ſaith the Lord, we have heard a voyce of trembling, of fear, and not of peace; wherefore do I ſee every man with his hands upon his loyns, as a woman in travel? it is even the time of</hi> Jacobs <hi>trouble, but he ſhall be ſaved out of it.</hi> From hence alſo we may ſee, that the natural ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the Jews as a foreſaid) is the Woman that is to travel, ſpoken of <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, It further appears, that the travelling Woman, is Zion, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Jews) from the words of the Prophet, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.6, 7, 8, 9.10. which ſaith, <hi>A voyce of noiſe from the City, a voyce from the Temple, a voyce of the Lord that rendreth recompence to his enemies; before ſhe TRAVELLED ſhe brought forth, before her pains came ſhe was delivered of a MAN CHILD; who hath heard of ſuch a thing? who hath ſeen ſuch a thing? ſhall the earth be made to bring forth in one day? or ſhall a Nation be born at once? for as ſoon as Zion tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled ſhe brought forth her Children; ſhall I bring to the birth, and not cauſe to bring forth, ſaith the Lord? ſhall I cauſe to bring forth,

and ſhut the womb, ſaith thy God: Rejoyce ye with JER<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SALEM, and be glad with her all ye that love her; ſo will I comfort you, and ye ſhall be comforted in JER<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SALEM.</hi> From this Text we may alſo clearly ſee, that the travelling Woman, is Zion, namely, the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, even the Jews, as is above expreſſed; for here is the very Woman and the Man-child mentioned, which <hi>John</hi> ſpake of in <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. and I do not find, that the Scripture in any place elſe ſpeaks of a Woman and a Man-child, agreeing with the Text, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. ſave this Text, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.6, 7, 8, 9, 10. which ſpeaks (as it were) the very ſame; there is in many places ſpoken of Zions travel, but not the word MAN-CHILD uſed, ſo that we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that this is the Text which giveth us light to underſtand who is the Woman, and who is her Son or Child, and we ſee that it is clearly applyed to the Jews, the Mother, and the Gentiles, the Man-child; for there is the word Zion and Jeruſalem mentioned in the Text, and the Gentiles ſucking of her breaſt, a metaphor of a Woman and her Child; but more of this anon, but from what is already ſaid, it appears, that the travelling Woman is Zion, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo Zion is to be underſtood the two Tribes: and ſo I ſhall paſs this, and come to the ſecond thing, namely, to ſhew who is this Man-child ſpoken of <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. which is:</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Man-child I underſtand to be the Gentile Church, even all the faithful in the primitive times, and downwards, amongſt whom there was a few Jews, but not a number worth ſpeaking of, in conſideration of the whole Houſe of Judah, nor in compariſon of the Gentiles, but as it were a tenth, according to the words of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> chap. 6.10, 11, 12, 13. and that the converted Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles (or Goſpel Church) is to be underſtood the Man-child, ſpoken of by <hi>John, Revel.</hi> 12. I ſhall give theſe Scriptures and Scripture Reaſons following to prove it.</p>
                  <p>And in the firſt place, I ſhall ſhew, that the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> who clearly propheſied of the ſame thing that <hi>John</hi> ſaw, even the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and Man-child, ſheweth us, that the Woman is to be underſtood Zion or Jeruſalem, namely, the People called by that name, which were the Jews, and her Man-child to be the Gentile Church, as you may read, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 66.7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. in theſe words, <hi>Before ſhe travelled ſhe brought forth, before her pain came ſhe was delivered of a MAN-CHILD.</hi> From this verſe we ſee, that there is a <hi>Man-child</hi> ſpoken of, which was to be brought forth, agreeing with the Text, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. only this Text ſaith, that <hi>before ſhe travelled ſhe
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:119763:100"/>
brought forth;</hi> and the Text, <hi>Revel</hi> 12.2. ſaith, <hi>ſhe being with child, cried, travelling in birth, pained to be delivered.</hi> Theſe two Texts of Scripture ſpeak of one and the ſame thing, and yet ſeems to contradict one another, the which I ſhall reconcile; the word <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel,</hi> I underſtand to be meant this, that Judah being forſaken of her God, and given up to be made a Wanderer amongſt the Nations, was to be ſorrowful as in a pained travelling condition, until the fulneſs of the Gentiles; and this is that which is to be underſtood from the Text, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. where it ſaith, <hi>ſhe cried travelling in birth, and pained to be delivered;</hi> and then at that time ſhall the Lord take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the vail of unbelief, and then ſhall they ſee Jeſus, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him to be their God, which they have waited for, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.9. and yet her perſecution after that time will be great, although it ſhall endure but for a ſhort time, for in the very time of the Gentiles being taken up, until the Lord ſhall deſcend upon the Mount of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lives, it is called the time of <hi>Jacobs</hi> trouble, and ſuch a day of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as never was ſince there was a Nation upon the earth, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.1, 2, 3. <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 30. So then although the Church of Judah was given up for her unbelief, &amp; made a wanderer among the Nations, yet nevertheleſs her trouble will be greater in that nick of time, (thorow <hi>Moabs</hi> treachery, and the great Antichriſts violence, although the time of her trouble will be very ſhort) than even it was afore time; and that cauſed the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to ſay, <hi>BEFORE ſhe travelled ſhe brought forth, BEFORE her pains came ſhe was d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of a MAN-CHILD;</hi> implying, that ſhe was to travel and be pained afterwards, for ſo ſaith the Text, <hi>BEFORE ſhe travelled, and BEFORE her pains came;</hi> implying, that ſhe was to travel and be in pain, but ſhe was to bring forth firſt; ſo that ſhe was to have pain and travail after her bringing forth the Man-child, and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this very Text that ſaith, <hi>Before ſhe travelled ſhe brought forth,</hi> alſo ſaith, that <hi>as ſoon as Zion travelled ſhe brough forth her Children:</hi> The ſum of all is this, that Zion or the Church of Judah, was given up unto unbelief, and to be ſcattered amongſt the Nation, until ſhe brought forth the Man-child, namely, until the fulneſs of the Gentiles, and ſo to be in a ſuffering condition; and alſo after ſhe was delivered of the Man-Child, ſhe muſt flie into the Wilderneſs, and there to be in a ſorrowful condition, and in pain and travail as it were, until all her children be brought forth, even the ten Tribes alſo which were carried away by <hi>Salmonazar</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> be brought back, and made one Sheep-fould, ſo as not to be divided
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:119763:100"/>
into two Nations any more at all; that the firſt dominions may come to the daughter of Zion; and that they are called the Womans ſeed, is clear, for we may ſee, that the ſmall number of the ten Tribes which were not of Judah, and yet lived amongſt them ſince the dayes of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> are called the remnant of her ſeed, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not (rationally) be underſtood any other people, but a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ten Tribes, as I could ſhew from the Prophets at large; but becauſe of the want of time, I paſs from this Objection, (or the reconciliation of the Text, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. with <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.) and come to give you Reaſons drawn from the Scriptures, to prove the Gentile Church to be the Man-child ſpoken of in <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. and ſo to the firſt; which is,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe the Text <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. imports ſo much, in theſe words, <hi>Then ſhall ye ſuck, ye ſhall be born upon her ſides, and dandled upon her knees, as one whom HIS Mother comforteth, ſo will I comfort you, and ye ſhall be comforted in Jeruſalem:</hi> and that this is ſpoken of the Gentiles that ſhall flow in or be converted, is clear from the firſt clauſe of the verſe, in theſe words, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.12. <hi>For thus ſaith the Lord, behold I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Gentiles like a flowing ſtream. Then ſhalt thou ſee and flow together, and thine heart ſhall fear and be enlarged, becauſe the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of the ſea ſhall be converted unto thee, the forces of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſhall come unto thee,</hi> Chap. 60.6. So that Judah is to be troden under foot (in a ſorrowful pained and travelling condition) till the fulneſs of the Gentiles be come in, and then there ſhall be a participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of each others glory; as the Gentiles ſhall ſuck of her breaſt and milk out, and rejoyce in the abundance of her glory, even ſo ſhall ſhe afterwards when her child, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Gentile Church) is come to full age, (namely, when it ſhall deſcend with Chriſt, and take its Government with him, to rule the Nations with a rod of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron then ſhall the Jews ſuck their breaſt, namely, partake of their glory, who ſhall judge the world in righteouſneſs: So then the firſt Reaſon to prove the Man-child to be the faithful Gentiles is, becauſe the Jews are mentioned in the Text as the Mother, and the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Gentiles as the Man-child, ſucking her breaſt; and alſo becauſe ſhe is to be troden under foot until the fulneſs of the Gentiles: So then her travelling in pain to be delivered of a Man-child, to rule all Nations with a rod of Iron, is to be the bringing in the fulneſs of the Gentiles; ſo that the Gentile Goſpel Church being compleated, and riſen from the dead (which ſhall be at the time of the appearing
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:119763:101"/>
of Chriſt in the clouds at the ſame time, when the Jews ſhall ſee him and believe in him) becauſe that Man-child that ſhall rule all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with a rod of Iron. And,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the faithful Gentile Church, is the Man-child which is to rule all Nations with a rod of Iron, is clear, becauſe they are the people that have the promiſe made to them, to rule all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with a rod of Iron, even the very ſame thing which is ſpoken of the Man-child, for ſaith the Text, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. He was to <hi>rule all Nations with a rod of Iron:</hi> and that this is to be underſtood the faithful Gentile Church, who are to rule all Nations with a rod of Iron, read the words of the Lord Jeſus ſpoken by St. <hi>John, Revel.</hi> 2.26, 27. which ſaith, <hi>He that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the Nations; and he ſhall rule them with a rod of Iron; even as I have received of my Father,</hi> &amp;c. From whence we ſee, that the very ſame honour that God gave the Lord Jeſus, (ſpoken of in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. which was to rule all Nations with a rod of Iron) even the very ſame honour he hath given unto his Church, which followeth him in the regeneration, as it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to the Church of <hi>Thyatira.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And I call the Goſpel Church, the Church of the Gentiles, becauſe that there was but a very few Jews converted, it being the Gentiles day, and the Jews ſhut up under unbelief; yet I would not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to exclude the converted Jews of the ſame priviledges that the converted Gentiles ſhall have, for they are all one in Chriſt, and to have all one priviledge: And as for the Man-child which is to rule all Nations with a rod of Iron, we ſee plainly, that it is the Gentile or Goſpel Church, as is promiſed to the Church of <hi>Thyatira;</hi> and they are alſo called joynt heirs with Chriſt, that as Chriſt had that honour put upon him, even ſo did Chriſt put it upon his Church, which is his Body; and thus I paſs this ſecond Reaſon, ſaying, that it is plain, that the Man-child was to rule all Nations with a rod of Iron; and I find none have that honour put upon them but Chriſt, and the Goſpel or Gentile Church; for the whole Houſe of Iſrael have not that honour, becauſe the Scripture ſaith, that the convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Goſpel Church ſhall judge the twelve Tribes of Iſrael; ſo then the Man-child ſpoken of <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. is either Chriſt or the Goſpel Gentile Church, becauſe none elſe have the promiſe of ruling all Nations with a rod of Iron: and that the Man-child is not meant Chriſt, I could give many Reaſons, if I did find any that did affirm it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I find none aſſert it, I ſhall ſpare my pains.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="189" facs="tcp:119763:101"/>And ſecondly, if it be not Chriſt which is called the Man-child, which was to rule all Nations with a rod of Iron, then it muſt needs be the Gentile Church, becauſe none elſe have the honour promiſed them to rule all Nations with a rod of Iron, but Chriſt and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Church: and thus I paſs to the third and laſt Reaſon to prove, that the Man-child ſpoken of in <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. is to be underſtood the Goſpel Church; which is,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly and laſtly, Becauſe the Man-child ſpoken of in <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. is to be caught up unto God, and to his Throne, before the Woman takes her flight into the Wilderneſs; the which agreeth not (as I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand to any thing elſe, ſave that of the Gentile-Church, who are to ariſe firſt from the dead, and be caught up to meet the Lord in the ayr, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.14, 15, 16. <hi>Revel</hi> 20.5, 6, 7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.40, 41. <hi>Luke</hi> 17.35, 36. And from the time of the Signs of Chriſts coming, until he ſhall deſcend upon the Mount of Olives, the Jews ſhall be in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, and every Family ſhall mourn apart, and there ſhall be a great mourning in Jeruſalem, as in <hi>HADADRIMMON</hi> in the valley of <hi>MEGIDDON, Zech.</hi> 12.10, 11, 12. And that the Jews ſhall then be living upon the earth in their bodies, before their change, at the very time when the Lord Jeſus ſhall come, is ſo plain, that I think that none can deny it, for the Scripture ſaith, it is the time of <hi>Jacobs</hi> trouble, and alſo ſaith, that in that day when Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem ſhall be ſpoiled, that then ſhall the Lord come and his feet ſtand upon the Mount of Olives: The two things which is obſervable to clear the truth of this Reaſon, and to ſhew the parrallel between the Man-child being caught up before the Womans flight, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the faithful Gentiles, and their being caught up to meet the Lord in the air; is, firſt, to ſhew that when the Lord Jeſus comes to raign upon the earth, that then there will be ſome living in the fleſh unchanged (or not changed) into an immortal ſtate: And ſecondly, to prove, that all the faithful ſhall be changed before he deſcends upon earth, and that they are to come with him, being before caught up to meet him: theſe things proved and well conſidered, will ſhew us, that the Man-child is no other but the Chriſtian Gentiles. And,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That there will be ſome, (namely, both Jews and Gentiles, although not ſuch Gentiles as were converted by a Goſpel preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) living upon earth at the Lord Jeſus his coming upon the earth, to take his Kingdome and to raign, is plain; for when the Lord ſhall have deſcended upon the Mount of Olives, and ſhall have made Jeruſalem the praiſe of the whole earth, when the voyce of weeping
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:119763:102"/>
ſhall be heard no more at all in her, (which will not be till after the very coming of Chriſt) and yet when all this ſhall be fulfilled, that Chriſt ſhall be in Jeruſalem, and rejoyce over his people there; even in that time of Chriſts raign, there ſhall be death and dying in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, for death is the laſt enemy that ſhall be conquered; and that there ſhall be dying after Chriſts raigning in Jeruſalem, is clear from the words of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> which ſaith, That <hi>the child ſhall die an hundred years old, and the ſinner being an hundred years old, ſhall be accurſed,</hi> Iſa. 65.19, 20. in theſe words, <hi>I will rejoyce in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and joy in my people; and the voyce of weeping ſhall be heard no more in her, nor the voyce of crying; there ſhall be no more thence an infant of dayes, nor an old man that hath not filled his dayes; for the child ſhall die an hundred years old, and the ſinner being an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years old ſhall be accurſed,</hi> &amp;c. From whence we may ſee, that there will be ſome (even the Jews) who ſhall live in the fleſh before their change, and yet Chriſt ſhall be with them in Jeruſalem: And where it is ſaid in <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. <hi>That there ſhall be no more death;</hi> that relates to the time when Chriſt ſhall have given up his Mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip into the hands of God the Father, after the laſt Judgment, ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. and I think it cannot be rationally imagined, that Chriſt ſhould raign over the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> in Jeruſalem a thouſand years, and no Generations to come into the world and paſs out of it again; yea it is certain that Chriſt ſhall dwell in Zion in Jeruſalem, and Jeruſalem ſhall be ſafely inhabited and abide for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, even from Generation to Generation; ſo that there ſhall be coming into the world and going out of it again, which is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the word, from <hi>GENERATION TO GENERATION, Iſa.</hi> 60.15. <hi>Joel.</hi> 3.20. So then it is certain, that ſome ſhall live in the fleſh, in the Kingdome of Chriſt, yea even all the Jews that live to his coming, and are not before converted unto Goſpel obedience, ſhall live in their fleſh and not be changed at the preſent, but ſhall be judged by the Goſpel Saints, and ſo paſs in their Generations gradually; as the Scripture declares, the which I before have ſpoken of; and thus I paſs the firſt thing, although more might be ſaid to it, but enough to prove, that there ſhall be ſome living in the fleſh, even the Jews, when Chriſt cometh, and alſo in the time of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. And,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, all the Gentile Saints ſhal be with Chriſt before he ſhal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend upon the Earth, for they ſhall be caught up into the Clouds to meet him, &amp; ſhall come with him, &amp; deſcend with him that they ſhall
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:119763:102"/>
all be caught up to meet him in the ayre, and come with him, is clear if we compare the words of <hi>Paul,</hi> and the words of the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> together, which ſaith, <hi>the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt, and we that are alive and remain, ſhall be caught up together with them in the Clouds to meet the Lord in the ayre, and ſo ſhall we be for ever with the Lord; For behold the Lord ſhall come with ten thouſand of his Saints,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.17. Jude 14. yea ſaith, Zech. 14.5. <hi>The Lord thy God ſhall come and ALL SAINTS with him:</hi> from whence we may ſee, that the Saints, yea all the faithful Gentiles are to be caught up to God and to his Throne to meet Chriſt, and yet the Jews to live and remain in their fleſh, and to have Chriſt their King raigning over them in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> from generation to generation, which being truly weighed it amounts to this, that the Woman flying into the Wilderneſs is the Jews, and that the Man-child which before is caught up to God, is the Chriſtian Gentiles; and thus much as to the third reaſon, to prove that the Gentile Church is the Man-child ſpoken of in <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. although I could ſpeak more unto it if time would admit of it, but time would faile me to ſpeak to theſe things in particular becauſe they be very large, and as the thing it ſelf is not ſo pleain and eaſie to be underſtood as ſome other ſubjects are; even ſo the proof of Scriptures relating to it, is more dubious, and wants a larger explication than other Scriptures (to other ſubjects want) for there is to the proof of this thing, much in <hi>Mich.</hi> 5. from the 3. verſe to the end of the Chapter, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places ſpeak to this thing, but what hath been ſaid is ſufficient to prove the Woman to be Zion (namely <hi>Judah</hi>) and the Man-child to be the Chriſtian Gentiles, for as the Woman is to travail, and be in pain, even ſo it is until the fulneſs of the Gentiles be come in, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>to bring forth the fulneſs of the Gentiles,</hi> and alſo the reſtoring the other ten Tribes, the remnant of his brethren into their former capacity, and to a better eſtate than that of the firſt, when the envie of <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſhall depart, ſo as that <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſhall not envie <hi>Judah,</hi> nor <hi>Judah</hi> vex <hi>Ephraim</hi> any more at all: and the Man-child is clearly ſeen to be the faithful Gentiles, becauſe they are to rule all Nations with a rod of Iron, as is promiſed to the Church of <hi>Thyatirah,</hi> and as they are to rule all Nations with a rod of Iron, even ſo they are to be caught or taken up to meet the Lord in the ayre, and the other to be left behind, for as they are to be Chriſts glorious (army and ſeen in Heaven) even ſo they ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend with him, and are called Prince decreeing judgment, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:119763:103"/>
and Saviours coming on Mount-Zion judging the Mount of <hi>Eſau,</hi> when the Kingdoms ſhall be the Lords, and they judging the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but I ſhall leave this and come to the opening of the other things before mentioned, in the which I ſhall be very brief at preſent, yet full enough to ſhew the truth of it; and ſo I paſs to the third thing in order, which is the remnant of her ſeed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as touching the remnant of her ſeed, we may obſerve the words as they lie, which is thus read, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.17. <hi>And the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon was wrath with the Woman, and went to make war with the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of her ſeed, which kept the Commandements of God, and have the Teſtimony of Jeſus;</hi> from whence we may take notice, that there is not only a Man-child brought forth by the Woman (that is to rule all Nations with a rod of Iron, which is caught up unto God and to his Throne before the Woman flieth into the Wilderneſs) but alſo there remaineth a remnant of her ſeed, that the Dragon makes war withal, when he ſeeth he cannot devour the Man-child, nor carry away the Woman with the floud, which he caſt forth out of his mouth; now the remnant of her ſeed is as well mentioned in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66. as in <hi>Revel.</hi> 12 17. for there is mention made of the Man-child, ſaying, <hi>Before ſhe travailed ſhe brought forth, before her pains came ſhe was delivered of a Man-child;</hi> and with all ſaith, <hi>Who hath heard of ſuch a thing, ſhall the earth be made to bring forth at one day, or a Nation be born at once? for as ſoon at Zion travailed ſhe brought forth her Children.</hi> Iſa. 66 8. So then as here is ſpoken of a Man-child, even ſo here is ſpoken of Children, which agreeth with <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.17. where there is mention made of the remnant of her ſeed, ſo then as the Chriſtian Gentiles are the Man-child, even ſo there is a remnant of the twelve Tribes, which may fitly be called the remnant of her ſeed.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That there is a remnant left in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which ſhall be perſecuted and worn out by the Antichriſt for the three years and a half, is clear, the which I ſhall ſpeak unto in its diſtinct order, and firſt to the firſt; that is, that there is a remnant left in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> when the woman flyeth into the Wilderneſs, or into captivity, as it is called captivity as well as the Wilderneſs, for to be baniſhed from our native country, and to be caſt amongſt our enemies, may fitly be called captivity; and that there is a remnant to be left in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> which do not thus flee, or be thus perſecuted from their houſes and habitations, when the City ſhall be taken and trod un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:119763:103"/>
foot, is clear from, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.2. in theſe words, <hi>For I will gather all Nations againſt</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>to battail, &amp; the City ſhall be taken, &amp; the houſes rifled, and the women raviſhed, and HALF of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhall go into captivity, and the reſidue of the people ſhall not be cut off from the City.</hi> From whence we may ſee, that ſome ſhall go forth unto captivity, and the others ſhall remain in the City, which is called in, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.17. the remnant of her ſeed; ſo then in the firſt place you ſee, that ſome ſhall go forth of the City at the time when the Gentiles ſhall take it and ſpoile it, and a remnant ſhall not be cut off from the City but ſhall remain in it, and that remnant ſhall be worn out as it were, by that wicked perſon: and that it is not Zion, namely the two Tribes is clear (for ſhe is then out of his reach) but that they are of the Tribes of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> is as clear, for they are the people that he ſhall make war with, and wear them out, they are called the children of <hi>Daniels</hi> people, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.2. <hi>chap.</hi> 7.25. So then, firſt there is a remnant left which flie not, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.2. And ſecondly, they are the people that are to be worn out, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.25. and 12.7. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.19. And that they may be called the remnant of her ſeed, the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (alluding to the very ſame thing) ſaith, <hi>It ſhall come to paſs in that day, that the REM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NANT of</hi> Iſrael, (viz. the remnant of Zions ſeed) <hi>and ſuch as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape of the houſe of</hi> Iacob, <hi>ſhall no more again ſtay upon them that ſmote them, but ſhall ſtay upon the Lord the holy one of</hi> Iſrael <hi>in truth; the remnant ſhall return, even the remnant of</hi> Jacob <hi>unto the mighty God, therefore thus ſaith the Lord God of Hoaſt, O my people that dwell in Zion be not afraid of the Aſſyrian!</hi> (viz. the Antichriſt) <hi>he ſhall ſmite thee with a rod, and ſhall lift up his ſtaff againſt thee, after the manner of Egypt, for yet A VERY LITTLE WHILE</hi> (1260 dayes) <hi>and the indignation ſhall ceaſe, and my anger in their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and the Lord ſhall ſtir up a ſcourge for him; according to the ſlaughter of</hi> Midian <hi>at the rock</hi> Orib, <hi>and it ſhall come to paſs in that day, that his burthen ſhall be taken away from off thy ſhoulders, and his yoak from off thy neck,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, 27. this agrees with <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38. and 39. Chapters, and with <hi>Mich.</hi> 5. and many places that might be added, but I ſhall leave this, ſaying, that you may ſee that there is a people or a woman to flie into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and a remnant to remain in the City, which the Aſſyrian (<hi>viz.</hi> the Antichriſt) ſhall lift up his ſtaff againſt, and make war with them, agreeing with <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.27. and this remnant we ſee to be part of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael, Iſa.</hi> 10.20. and ſo I paſs to the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:119763:104"/>
next thing, which is the fourth thing, of the taking up of the Man-child to God, and to his Throne.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, as to this fourth particular I have already ſpoken to, and therefore at preſent I ſhall be very brief; ſaying, that by taking of the Man-child to God and to his Throne, I underſtand to be meant that at the time of the Lords firſt coming into the Clouds of Heaven, even into the ayr with his holy Angels, that then the war ſhall be in Heaven, between <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels, and the Devil and his Angels, and the Devil ſhall be caſt down, and with him his Angels, that the ayre may be cleared and made fit for Chriſt and his Saints to meet there, for in very deed I do underſtand, that God did confine the evil Angels unto (or into) the ayre for their reſidence until the reſurrection of the Saints, and the taking up of the living, which I underſtand to be the Man-child; and juſt at (or a little before) the time that they are taken up, the Devil ſhall be caſt down into the earth, at which time he ſhall give the Beaſt his ſeat, and power and great authority, and in that time there will be lying ſigns and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles wrought, at which time it ſhall be ſaid <hi>Woe, woe, woe, be to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Earth and Sea, for the Devil is come down with great wrath, becauſe he knoweth that his time is ſhort;</hi> and ſeeing himſelf caſt down, he ſhall perſecute the Woman, and God ſhall give her the wings of an Eagle that ſhe may flie from his face, and that will cauſe him to make war with the remnant of her ſeed, in which time the Lord ſhall abate his wrath and cruelty, (which he would exerciſe in and by the Beaſt, upon the remnant of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſeed) by pouring out his Vials on the Beaſt, and by giving power to his two witneſſes, not only to Propheſie and eſtabliſh the remnant of the Womans ſeed left in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) but alſo to ſmite the Beaſt and his followers with plagues ſo often as they pleaſe, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. And in ſhort thus, the taking up of the Man-child, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand is, when the Lord ſhall firſt appear in the Clouds (as before ſaid) that then he ſhall with a voyce, and with the ſound of a Trumpet, awake the dead and gather all the living Saints together, both the raiſed dead, and changed living, and forthwith they ſhall be caught up to meet Chriſt, but the reſt of the dead men ſhall not live again until a thouſand years after, <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.6, 7, 8. neither ſhall the living which have not before prepared themſelves to meet the Bride-groom (by walking in his wayes and keeping his Ordinances) be taken up, but ſhall be left upon earth; there is none but thoſe that are accounted as Eagles, that ſhall be with Chriſt;
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:119763:104"/>
                     <hi>for where the carkas is there ſhall the Eagles be gathered together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> that is, where Chriſt is, thither will his body, namely the Goſpel Church (or his bride) be, and this is clear from many Scriptures that the Saints ſhall be firſt raiſed, and caught up before the reſt of the dead or living; as I before (in this Book) have proved at large; and thus I paſs this fourth particular, and come to the fifth; which is,</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The fifth thing is, the place into which the Woman is to flie, and that I underſtand is into the Wilderneſs of <hi>Moab;</hi> that ſhe is to flie into a Wilderneſs, is clear, where ſhe is to be hid from the face of the Serpent, and to be nouriſhed by the Lord (that is by the Lords appointment) and that he hath appointed her to flie from the Serpent, that ſhe may be hid from his face; is clear from the words of the Text, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.14. And ſecondly, we may as plainly know what place ſhe was to hide in, or what place was to be her hiding place; if we peruſe the Scriptures; as firſt, that we may ſee that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ab,</hi> or the Wilderneſs of <hi>Moab,</hi> was to be her hiding place, read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 16.1,, 3, 4, 5. in theſe words, <hi>Send ye the Lamb to the ruler of the Land, from</hi> Sela <hi>to the Wilderneſs, unto the Mount of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Zion; take counſel, execute judgement, make thy ſhadows as the night in the midſt of the noon day, hide the outcaſts, bewray not him that wandreth. Let my outcaſt dwell with thee,</hi> Moab, <hi>be thou a cover for them from the face of the ſpoiler: for the extortioner is at an end, the ſpoiler ceaſeth, the oppreſſors are conſumed out of the Land. And in mercy ſhall the Throne be eſtabliſhed, and he ſhall ſit upon it in truth, in the Tabernacle of</hi> David, <hi>judging, and ſeeking judgment, and haſtening righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. From theſe words we may ſee, that as God hath appointed the Woman to flie from the face of the ſpoiler, even ſo he hath ſhewed us the place where, even in the Wilderneſs of <hi>Moab,</hi> there is the Lamb, or the Preſent to be ſent, even to the Wilderneſs unto the Mount of the Daughter of Zion; and that we may know alſo what Wilderneſs it is that the Lord ſends the Woman into, that ſhe may hide her ſelf from the face of the ſpoiler; he tels us it is the Wilderneſs of <hi>Moab,</hi> ſaying, <hi>hide the outcaſt, bewray not him that wandreth, let my outcaſt dwell with thee,</hi> Moab, <hi>be thou a cover for them from the face of the ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler:</hi> From whence we may plainly ſee, that the place that God had prepared for the Woman to flie into from the face of the Serpent, was the Wilderneſs of <hi>Moab;</hi> I could ſhew (if time would admit) how the Lord brought them thither (it being as it were a type of

And thus I come to the ſixth particular, which is the time of her abode in the Wilderneſs.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, As for the time of the Womans abode in the Wilderneſs, and the trouble of the remnant of her ſeed which remain in <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> I underſtand to be three years and an half, in which time the two witneſſes ſhall propheſie in ſackcloath; and that it is ſo, read, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.2, 3. compared with <hi>chap.</hi> 12.6.14. and <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.25. <hi>chap.</hi> 12.7. in theſe words, <hi>And to the Woman was given two wings of a great Eagle, that ſhe might flie into the Wilderneſs into her place, where ſhe is nouriſhed for a time, and times, and halfe a time, from the face of the Serpent; Hide my outcaſt, let my outcaſt dwell with thee,</hi> Moab, <hi>be thou a cover for them from the face of the ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers: and the Woman fled into the Wilderneſs where ſhe hath a place prepared of God, that they ſhould feed her there, a thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and threeſcore dayes; Send ye the Lamb to the Rulers of the Land, from</hi> Sela <hi>to the Wilderneſs, to the Mount of the Daughter of Zion, for the Wilderneſs and Solitary plac<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

From theſe Scriptures we may ſee, that <hi>Moab</hi> is the Wilderneſs or hiding place for Zion, into which ſhe is to flee to be hid from the face of the ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, or Serpent, and the time we alſo ſee, to be a time, and times, and halfe a time, or a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore dayes, or as it is in <hi>chap.</hi> 11.2, 3. called forty and two months, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accounted (according to the Jews account) thirty dayes, for a month, it amounts juſt unto three years and an half, for a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore dayes, makes forty and two months, and forty and two months, makes juſt three years and a half; ſo then the time of <hi>Jeruſalems</hi> being trod under foot, and of the wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Saints of the moſt high (namely the remnant of the Womans ſeed which abode in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) and of the Womans abode in the Wilderneſs, is juſt three years and a half, and not a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore years, as Mr. <hi>Henden</hi> (and ſome other expoſiters) ſaith: and further to prove that it is but three years and a half, according to the litteral account, both in <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Revelation,</hi> (and not ſo long a time as before mentioned) I ſhall
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:119763:106"/>
give a few reaſons (drawn from the Scriptures) to prove it; and the firſt is,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe the ſcripture ſaith, that the ſeventh head (which is the eighth, and to go to perdition, which is the man of ſin, or the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> or vile perſon, or the ſpoiler) that when he cometh forth (to raign) that his time is but ſhort, that is, he ſhall continue but for a ſhort ſpace, as a ſeventh, but is to be the eighth (&amp; is the ſame that) is to wear out the Saints of the moſt high, and it ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en into his hands for a time, and times, and the dividing of time, read <hi>Revel.</hi> 17.10, 11, 12, 13. compared with <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.23, 24, 25, 26, 27. ſo that the ſeventh head, is to have but a ſhort ſpace, or time to raign, and alſo the eighth ſpoken by St. <hi>John,</hi> is to continue but a ſhort ſpace, even a Time, and Times, and half a Time; ſpoken of by <hi>Daniel,</hi> which is juſt three years and a half, as I before (in this Treatiſe) have proved, by ſhewing what is to be underſtood by <hi>TIME,</hi> and <hi>TIMES,</hi> and half a <hi>TIME;</hi> comparing the word <hi>TIME,</hi> and <hi>TIMES,</hi> with the ſeven <hi>TIMES,</hi> which was the ſeven years of <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> being caſt out into the open field, and eating graſs with the Oxen until he did acknowledge the Lord only, to rule in the Kingdomes of men, and giveth it to whom ſoever he will, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.25. So then the <hi>TIME</hi> is to be underſtood one year, and <hi>TIMES</hi> (in the plural number) is to be underſtood two years, and the half <hi>TIME</hi> (or dividing of <hi>TIME</hi>) is to be underſtood half a year, according to the true account of <hi>Daniel,</hi> from the word <hi>TIME,</hi> or <hi>TIMES)</hi> the which amounts to no longer Time than juſt three years and an half, which is that ſhort ſpace that St. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of the Beaſts continuance in troubling the Saints, or the ſealed number.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Time further appears to be but three years and an half, becauſe as it is called, one thouſand two hundred and three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore dayes, even ſo it is alſo called; <hi>FORTY AND TWO MONTHS,</hi> which is juſt three years and a half; and alſo a Time and Times, and half a Time, being compared with Forty and two Months, ſheweth clearly what Time is to be underſtood by the one thouſand two hundred and threeſcore dayes, that it is juſt three years and a half.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It further appears to be but three years and a half, and not ſo long as a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore years, (that Jeruſalem ſhall be taken and troden under foot, and the people per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted) becauſe this taking of the City, and treading of it under
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:119763:106"/>
foot, is to be after the meaſuring line hath paſſed over the City in the latter dayes, (as I before have ſhewed) that when Judah com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out of her long captivity, then ſhall ſhe ſit upon the repairing of her breaches, and before ſhe hath finiſhed her Walls and outward Court, there ſhall be a ſtop put to it by the Antichriſt, as it was in the dayes of Judah coming out of Babylon, that there was a ſtop in their building, in the dayes of <hi>Syrias</hi> until the dayes of <hi>Darias,</hi> which was a type of this ſtop and hinderance in the work (as I before have ſhewed) ſo then if we conſider this interruption of Iſrael, and the time when) even when they be newly brought out of captivity, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Prophet <hi>Ezekiels</hi> words, <hi>Chap.</hi> 38.) it clearly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, that the time muſt be very ſhort, agreeing with the Prophet <hi>Zechariahs</hi> words, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.1, 2, 3. which ſaith, <hi>Behold the day of the Lord cometh, and the ſpoil ſhall be divided in the midſt of thee, and I will gather all Nations againſt Jeruſalem to battail, and the City ſhall be taken,</hi> agreeing with <hi>Revel.</hi> 11. which ſaith, <hi>The holy City ſhall they tread under foot forty and two months; then ſhall the Lord go forth, and fight againſt thoſe Nations, as he fought in the day of battail; and his feet ſhall ſtand in that day upon the Mount of Olives.</hi> This being well obſerved, may clearly be ſeen to be a thing falling upon Iſrael in the latter dayes; and that the time of their trouble THEN, (after their great and long time of being ſcattered amongſt the Nations) ſhall be very ſhort, and not exceed the time of three years and a half.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and laſtly, It appears to be but a very ſhort time (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the time before mentioned) becauſe the two Prophets are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie all the time of the Womans flight, to eſtabliſh the remnant of the Womans ſeed, and to ſmite the Antichriſt and his followers with plagues, as <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> did ſmite <hi>Pharaoh</hi> (King of <hi>Egypt</hi>) for his wickedneſs againſt the Children of Iſrael; and that the two Prophets (or Witneſſes) are to Propheſie all the time of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans flight and abode in the Wilderneſs, and of the holy Cities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trod under foot; is clear from the words of <hi>St. John, Revel.</hi> 11.2, 3. in theſe words, <hi>The holy City ſhall they tread under foot forty and two months; and I will give power unto my two Witneſſes, and they ſhall propheſie a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore dayes, cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in ſackloth.</hi> From whence we may ſee, that the time of the Womans flight and abode in the Wilderneſs, and the perſecution of the Remnant of her ſeed which remain in Jeruſalem, is but for the ſpace of three years and a half; becauſe as it is called, but for a ſhort
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:119763:107"/>
ſpace, and forty and two Months, Time, and Times, and half a Time; even ſo it is but to endure for the time of the propheſying of the two Prophets in Sackcloth, which cannot be long, much leſs one thouſand two hundred and threeſcore years, nay, it is but the juſt time that the Scripture calls it, take it either way, namely, a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore dayes, or forty and two Months, or Time, and Times, and dividing of Time, which is juſt three years and an half, as before ſaid: And thus I come to the next particular, which is the ſeventh and eighth thing, which I ſhall put together, and make the ſeventh compleat (with it) to ſhew who are the two Prophets (or Witneſſes) and where they are to prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and to whom.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, The two Prophets, I underſtand to be two men ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and ſet apart by the Lord for that work, to propheſie before Nations and Kings, to turn the hearts of the Fathers to the Children, and the hearts of the Children to the Fathers; that the Lord may be one, and his Name one upon the Mountains of Iſrael; and theſe two perſons (or men as I underſtand them to be) the one I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand to be <hi>Elijah,</hi> (or <hi>Elias</hi> which is one) and the other <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle; and that <hi>Elijah</hi> is one, read <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.5. which ſaith, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I will ſend you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the Great and DREADF<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L DAY of the Lord, and he ſhall turn the hearts of the Fathers unto the Children, and the hearts of the Children unto their Fathers; left I come and ſmite the earth with a Curſe.</hi> From this Text we find that <hi>Elijah</hi> (or <hi>Elias</hi>) is to come before the <hi>GREAT and DREADF<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L DAY of the Lord,</hi> and Chriſts co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in the fleſh, when he was born of the Virgin, was not the <hi>Great and Dreadful Day</hi> of the Lord, for he came in ſuch a mean way in that day, that he was not dreadful to his enemies, but they were bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unto him, as to whip him, and ſmite him with their hands, and crucifie him; and indeed that day of his coming was ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dreadful day (or the notable day) of the Lord, that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that day was propheſied on this wiſe, <hi>Who hath believed our report? or to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? for he is deſpiſed and rejected of men, he was numbred with the tranſgreſſors, and bare the ſins of many, and made interceſſion for the tranſgeſſors,</hi> Iſa. 53.1, 3, 12. even ſo ſaith the Prophet <hi>Zachariah,</hi> Chap. 9.9. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce greatly O daughter of Zion, ſhout O daughter of Jeruſalem, the King cometh unto thee, he is juſt and having ſalvation, lowly and riding upon an Aſſe, and upon a Colt the foal of an Aſſe.</hi> All which
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:119763:107"/>
ſheweth, (with many more that might be added) that the coming of the Lord in the day when he was born of the Virgin, was not that <hi>notable</hi> or <hi>dreadful</hi> day of the Lord, but a day little noted, ſo as but few to believe his report. And,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, where it is ſaid, that the hearts of the Fathers (in that day) ſhould be turned to the Children, and the hearts of the Children unto the Fathers, is clearly ſeen not to be meant the coming of the Lord in his firſt day, of whom <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt was a forerunner, to prepare his way; for in that day, (as was propheſied of him) he came to ſet a man at variance againſt his Father, <hi>Micah</hi> 7.6. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.34, 35, 36. <hi>Luke</hi> 12.49, 50, 51, 52. in theſe words, <hi>Think not that I am come to ſend peace on earth, I came not to ſend peace but a ſword; for I am come to ſet a man at variance againſt his Father, and the daughter againſt her Mother; and the daughter in law a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinſt her Mother in law, and a mans foes ſhall be they of his own houſhold;</hi> compared with <hi>Luke</hi> 12.53. which ſaith, That <hi>the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall be divided againſt the Son, and the Son againſt the Father, the Mother againſt the Daughter, and the Daughter againſt the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> All which clearly ſheweth, that the coming of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus in his firſt day, when hew was born of the Virgin) was not that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table or dreadful day of the Lord, of which <hi>Elias</hi> was to be a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runner of; but relates to another day, in order to the reconciling of that great difference between the Parents and Children, which difference and diviſion was begat (between the Parents and their Children) by Chriſts firſt coming, who came not (as he ſaith him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſend peace upon the earth, but a ſword, namely, a houſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, the Father againſt the Son, the Son againſt the Father, &amp;c. but becauſe, I ſhall haſten to the Concluſion, I ſhall wave all long circumlocutions, and in ſhort ſay (as beforeſaid) that <hi>Elijah</hi> (or <hi>Elias</hi>) is yet to come before the great and dreadful day of the Lord, to turn the hearts of the Fathers to the Children, who is to be one of the two Prophets (or Witneſſes) to eſtabliſh the remnant of the Womans ſeed, namely, the Children of Iſrael which remain in the City after the Womans flight into the Wilderneſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> But againſt this is objected (from the words of Chriſt) that <hi>Elias</hi> is already come, which was <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.14. <hi>Mark</hi> 9.11, 12, 13. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.16, 17.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt was a fore-runner of Chriſt in his firſt day, is not denied, and that he came in the power and ſpirit of <hi>Elias</hi> is as clear; for as <hi>Elias</hi> ſhall, and did bear witneſs, to (and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:119763:108"/>
for) the Lord, even ſo did <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and ſo was a lively type of the <hi>Elias</hi> which is to come; for the type or figure of the thing is often called by the name of the thing it ſelf, and ſo we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Chriſts words here, where he ſaith, That <hi>Elias is already come,</hi> meaning <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt; or otherwiſe we ſet Chriſts words and <hi>Johns</hi> words one to contradict another; for the Scripture ſaith, That <hi>John did no Miracle, and yet all that he ſpake of him was true,</hi> John 10.41. and <hi>John</hi> himſelf (when the Jews ſent Prieſts and Levites from Jeruſalem to him, ſaying, Who art thou? art thou <hi>Elias?</hi>) he <hi>ſaid I am not Elias,</hi> John 1.19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>But him of whom the Prophet Iſaiah ſpake of, ſaying, I am the voyce of one crying in the Wilderneſs,</hi> &amp;c. So then from hence we may ſee, that <hi>John</hi> was a true Prophet, and ſpake the truth; and yet when it was demanded of him, whether he was the <hi>Elias</hi> which was to come; he ſaid, I am not <hi>Elias:</hi> From whence I conclude, that although <hi>John</hi> came in the ſpirit of <hi>Elias,</hi> and was a type or figure of him, and ſo might be called by the Lord <hi>Elias,</hi> (he calling the figure of the thing by the name of the thing figured) yet no more the <hi>Elias</hi> which was to come before the great and dreadful day of the Lord, than the Bread and the Cup of the holy Supper of the Lord, is the real Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; and yet Chriſt himſelf ſaith, <hi>Take, EAT, THIS IS MY BODY, which is broken for you;</hi> and yet it was but a figure of his Body, to ſhew forth his death, to keep us in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance thereof; and alſo we ſee, that there was pictures made with Gold out of the Mercy ſeat, with wings to cover the Mercy ſeat, and they were called <hi>Cherubims,</hi> and yet were not real <hi>Cherubims,</hi> but were a figure of the <hi>Cherubims,</hi> or did only repreſent them: So that we may ſee, that the thing repreſenting, is called by the name of the thing repreſented, or the figure of the thing, called by the name of the thing figured; and hence we may ſee (although I could ſay much more of things of this nature) that both Chriſts words, and alſo <hi>Johns</hi> were true; Chriſt calling <hi>John Elias,</hi> its to be underſtood <hi>John</hi> was a figure of <hi>Elias,</hi> or repreſented <hi>Elias,</hi> not only coming in the power and ſpirit of <hi>Elias,</hi> but he being a forerunner of Chriſt, in his firſt day, to perſwade the Jews to obedience to Chriſt, as <hi>Elias</hi> is to be a forerunner of Chriſt in his ſecond day; namely, the <hi>Great</hi> &amp; <hi>Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> day of the Lord, and to perſwade and eſtabliſh the Jews in their waiting for their King Jeſus, and their obedience unto him: And ſecondly, <hi>Johns</hi> words are true alſo, where he ſaith, I am not <hi>Elias,</hi> (that is, he was not that <hi>Elias</hi> really or ſimply underſtood) that
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:119763:108"/>
they looked for, although he was a type of him, and might by Chriſt be called by his name, as well as the bread which Chriſt brake might be called his body; or the pictures of Cherubims called Cherubims, and Chriſt called <hi>David;</hi> and many ſuch like things that borrow their name from the things which they repreſent: and thus much briefly by way of Anſwer to the Objection, and the reconciliation of the words of Chriſt, and the words of <hi>John,</hi> which ſeemingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts each other; but being underſtood accordingly as they were ſpoken they agree together; ſo then ſtill it remains that <hi>Elias</hi> is to come before the <hi>GREAT AND DREADF<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L DAY</hi> of the Lord; and that it is to be <hi>Elias</hi> really ſo underſtood; I give theſe reaſons (which before have been mentioned in general) in a ſhort and brief method.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt was not the real <hi>Elias,</hi> as I think all will confeſs, for he was the Son of <hi>Zacharias,</hi> and <hi>Zacharias</hi> had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement from the Lord, to call the name of his Son (not <hi>Elias</hi> but) <hi>John, Luke</hi> 1.13. But <hi>ELIAS</hi> is to come (as hath been proved) before the great and dreadful day of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt was not the forerunner (ſimply ſo conſidered) of the great and dreadful day of the Lord, for that day that <hi>John</hi> was a forerunner of, was the day of Chriſts ſufferings, and not the day of dread unto his enemies, ſo as it will be in that day that the chief Captains, and great and mighty men of the earth, ſhall call to the Mountains to fall upon them, and hide them from the preſence of the Lamb, for the great day of his wrath is come (ſay they) and who can ſtand; but <hi>Elias</hi> is to be the forerunner of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The hearts of the Fathers ſhall be turned unto the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and the hearts of the Children to their Fathers in that day, which yet are at a diſtance, for Chriſt ſake, ſo that the parents hate their Children, and Children ſhall betray their parents to death for Chriſts ſake; although it be not denyed that <hi>John</hi> (in a meaſure) was a type of <hi>Elias</hi> in that thing, according to the ſaying of the Angel to <hi>Zacharias, Luke</hi> 1.13, 18. For all men did account <hi>John</hi> a Prophet, and he preparing the way of the Lord, all <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> came out to him, to be Baptized of him in <hi>Jordan,</hi> and yet notwithſtanding afterwards were at great variance about Chriſt, ſome ſaying that he was a good man, and others ſaying nay, he hath a Devil and is mad, and after that laid violent hands on him, and crucified him; and the diſtance was ſo great that many families,

(even Parents and their Children) have been and are at a diſtance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, and ſo will be until that day of the coming of <hi>Elias,</hi> and then the hearts of the Fathers ſhall (thorowly) be turned unto their Children; and the hearts of the Children unto their Fathers; and envy ſhall depart from <hi>Ephraim,</hi> as before ſaid, which brings me to the fourth &amp; laſt reaſon, to prove <hi>Elias</hi> one of the two Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; which is,</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Becauſe the ſame judgments which was brought upon the earth by <hi>Elias</hi> when he was upon earth, ſhall be again brought upon the earth by the two Prophets (or witneſſes) <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.6. compared with <hi>James</hi> 5.17. 1 <hi>Kinge</hi> 17.1. which beſpeaks ſuch a thing, as though <hi>Elijah</hi> ſhould be one of thoſe two Witneſſes, if we alſo conſider that theſe Witneſſes muſt be ſlain, and therefore muſt be ſuch as never yet have taſted of death, becauſe it cannot be (ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally) imagined that thoſe Prophets which are ſo to die, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Prophets which are dead, and ſhall be raiſed from the dead, and then be ſlain again, (I ſpeak this becauſe ſome have ſuppoſed <hi>Moſes</hi> to be one of theſe two Prophets, which in reaſon cannot be ſo; neither do I find any Scripture warranting any ſuch thing) nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I find any where (in my moſt ſerious ſearch of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) of any extraordinary Prophets (namely ſuch Prophets as is mentioned in, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.) to be borne in the laſt dayes when this propheſie is to be accompliſhed; but <hi>Elijah</hi> never yet was ſlain but was caught up to Heaven in a whirle-wind; and ſo at preſent I ſhall leave this, and paſs to the next thing, which is to ſhew my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion who it is that is the other Prophet, becauſe the Text ſaith, that there is to be two Prophets, or two Witneſſes, which are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie in ſack-cloth; and as to the other Prophet, I ſhall be very brief, becauſe I do not find any ſuch Objection as I meet with againſt the fore mentioned Prophet, namely againſt <hi>Elias;</hi> and therefore I ſhall briefly ſhew my opinion and leave it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As for the other Prophet, which is to be a fellow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion with <hi>Elias,</hi> I underſtand to be <hi>John,</hi> that holy Apoſtle, the beloved Diſciple of Jeſus, which leaned upon his breaſt at Supper; for as <hi>Elias</hi> was a man highly in the love and favour of God, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though hated by men, and perſecuted, and baniſhed) even ſo was <hi>John</hi> dearly beloved of God, although hated, and baniſhed from men; yet the Lord Jeſus dealt with him, (by manifeſting of himſelf to him) as God did to <hi>Elijah,</hi> when he fled from the face of <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jeſſibel,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 17. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. but being in haſt I paſs many
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:119763:109"/>
things which otherwiſe were neceſſary, to be ſpake by way of paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel; and come to ſhew the reaſons why I underſtand <hi>John</hi> to be one of the two Witneſſes ſpoken of, in <hi>Revelations</hi> the 11. which are theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe when <hi>John</hi> writ the Goſpel of Chriſt, (which was ſuppoſed to be thirty years after the aſcention of Chriſt) it was then reported amongſt the Diſciples that <hi>John</hi> was not to die, <hi>John</hi> 21.23. and yet at that time they had the ſpirit of the Lord to teach them. But if it ſhould be objected, and ſaid, <hi>that</hi> John <hi>ſaith, not that Chriſt ſaid he ſhould not die, but what if I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee fellow thou me;</hi> (ſignifying <hi>Peters</hi> death.)</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer and ſay, that it is true that Chriſt did not ſay in ſo many words, that <hi>John</hi> ſhould not die, for if he had it might have begat ſome diſlike, and murmuring amongſt his Diſciples, but he ſpake ſo plain that his Diſciples that had the holy Spirit did ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand him, and <hi>John</hi> himſelf who writ theſe things doth not contradict their opinion, but only ſaith, over the words that Chriſt had ſaid, which is; <hi>But if I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?</hi> and (indeed) their was great reaſon that <hi>John</hi> (who wrote theſe things) ſhould be very ſparing in the delivering of it, ſeeing Chriſt was ſparing, and becauſe the matter concerned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he might not gain any diſlike, or hatred from any of the Diſciples, becauſe of that thing: and as touching <hi>Johns</hi> death, I ſay it cannot be proved that he did ever die, neither do I believe that he did till I ſee better reaſon then I yet ſee to prove it, and if it be an errour, it is no other thing then what was received and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved of the Diſciples of Chriſt in that day, and they no where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for ſo believing; but becauſe I am a ſpeaking of <hi>Johns</hi> death, I ſhall ſhew you the opinion of ſome (or what they have written) as touching his death (although I would not be underſtood to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all what is written concerning him) <hi>Jerome</hi> ſaith (alledging it out of <hi>Tertullian</hi>) <hi>that in the time of</hi> Nero (though others ſay in the raign of <hi>Domitian</hi>) <hi>he was thrown</hi> (at Rome) <hi>into a tun of boiling oyle, and thereby he took no harm, but came forth after this tryal, purer than he went in;</hi> (and ſo ſaith <hi>Abdias</hi>) Auguſtine calls him <hi>a Martyr by will,</hi> and that which he writes of his end, is ſtrangeſt of all (which is) that <hi>John at Epheſus, cauſed his grave to be made, and in the preſence of divers went in alive, and being no ſooner in, but there ſeeming he was dead, they covered him, which
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:119763:110"/>
kind of reſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was rather to be termed a ſleep than death, for that the earth of the grave bubleth or boileth up after the manner of a well, by reaſon of Johns reſting therein, and breathing, a ſign of his ſlumbering therein;</hi> as you may ſee, <hi>(Auguſt.) in John, Tract.</hi> 124. &amp; alſo repeated by the tranſlator in his diſcourſe of the Apoſtles, and ſeventy Diſciples in <hi>Euſebius,</hi> 533 &amp; <hi>Euſebius Pamphilius</hi> (himſelf) ſaith, that he dyed at <hi>Epheſus, Euſebius,</hi> lib. 3. cap. 28. and indeed there is diviſion amongſt ancient writers, as touching <hi>John;</hi> but I ſhall leave theſe things and come to the ſecond Reaſon; which is,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe the Angel told <hi>John,</hi> that he muſt Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie again (not preach again) before many people and nations, and tongues, and kings; which relates to the time of the Nations being gathered together againſt <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the time of the Antichriſt, and the ten Kings that ſhall give their power unto the Beaſt, until the word of God be fulfilled, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.1, 2. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.24. <hi>Revel,</hi> 17.12, 13, 14. In this time, &amp; unto theſe people, or Nations, was <hi>John</hi> to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie, <hi>Revel.</hi> 10.11.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>There was given to ME a reed like unto a rod, and the Angel ſtood, ſaying, riſe, and meaſure the Temple of God, and the Altar, and them that worſhip therein. But the Court without the Temple, leave out, and meaſure it not: for it is given vnto the Gentiles, and the holy City ſhall they tread under foot forty and two moneths. And I will give power unto my two Witneſſes, and they ſhall Propheſie a thouſand two hundred and threeſcore dayes clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in ſackcloth.</hi> Revel. 11.1, 2, 3. From whence we may ſee, that <hi>John</hi> had not only (as it were) a new gift of Propheſie to be given unto him, that he might Propheſie again before Nations, tongues, and Kings, and the like; but alſo he was the man that was to meaſure <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> at the time of its laſt building, when the holy City was to be taken by the Gentiles, and trodden under foot, as I before have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and he is the other Prophet with <hi>Elias,</hi> which the Jews look for before the great day of the Lord, and demanded of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt if he was either of them, and he ſaid no, and they deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him why he then Baptized, (to prepare a people for the Lord) ſaying, <hi>Why Baptiſeth thou then, if thou be not that Chriſt nor Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, neither that Prophet;</hi> from whence we may ſee, that the Jews look for <hi>Elias</hi> and another Prophet, whoſe name is not mentioned, and therefore he is called that Prophet, (or a Prophet) not naming him, <hi>John</hi> 1.21, 25. As the Diſciple who was to tarry until Chriſt come, is not plainly mentioned, but called the Diſciple whom Chriſt
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:119763:110"/>
loved, who leaned upon his Breaſt at Supper, and the like; but we underſtand him to be <hi>John,</hi> becauſe the Text ſaith, <hi>this is the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that teſtifieth of theſe things, and wrote theſe things, and we know that his teſtimony is true;</hi> ſo then the Jews look for <hi>Elias</hi> and his companion another Prophet (even <hi>John</hi>) to be forerunners of Chriſt, and ſuch are the two Prophets, which are called the two Witneſſes to be, and doubtleſs are the ſame perſons; for they are ſuch as ſhall be ſlain, implying that they are ſuch men as yet have not taſted of death; and although ſome ſuppoſe that <hi>Enoch</hi> or <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhall be <hi>Elija's</hi> companion, to be one of the two Prophets, yet it is not my Judgment, for there is no reaſon for <hi>Moſes</hi> to be one who hath taſted of Death already, neither is there any mention made of him as to ſuch a work, and as for <hi>Enoch</hi> there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſpoken of him (neither) in reference to that work, but of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias</hi> there is, and alſo of <hi>John,</hi> for he is to meaſure the City, and to propheſie again before Kings, and there is great reaſon that one of theſe two Prophets ſhould be of the new Teſtament, a witneſs to Jeſus, as well as <hi>Elias</hi> of the old Teſtament, and yet both to be of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> was; and finally, the people that the two Witneſſes were to Propheſie unto, is the remnant of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans ſeed which remain in <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> and the place where they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie is in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> (in the preſence or) before Kings and Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the like, gathered together into <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> in which place the two Witneſſes ſhall be ſlain when they have finiſhed their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, by the Beaſt, namely, the Antichriſt; and at the end of three dayes and an half, the Spirit of life ſhall enter into them again, and they ſhall aſcend into Heaven to meet the Lord and his glorious ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, juſt at the nick of time when he is ready to deſcend upon the Mount of Olives; and the next thing which ſhall immediately fall out upon the City and the people, (<hi>viz.</hi> the wicked Gentiles, <hi>Gogg</hi> and his company) ſhall be the great Earth-quake, which ſhall ſlay ſeven thouſand men; and the next, the Kingdomes of this World, ſhall become the Kindomes of our Lord, and his Chriſt; and he ſhall raign for ever and ever, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. But if it ſhould be doubted, whether the two witneſſes ſhould be ſlain in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> becauſe it is ſaid that <hi>their dead bodies ſhall lie in the ſtreets of the great City, which ſpiritually is called</hi> Sodom, <hi>and</hi> Egypt, <hi>where alſo our Lord was crucified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is clearly ſeen to be Jeruſalem, becauſe it is ſaid, where our Lord was crucified, and it is called <hi>Sodom,</hi> becauſe of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:119763:111"/>
for as the men of <hi>Sodom</hi> gave themſelves up to fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to follow ſtrange fleſh, even ſo ſhall it then be in Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, that the wicked and ungodly Gentiles (<hi>viz. Goggs</hi> Army) ſhall raviſh the women in the ſtreets, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.2. and give themſelves up to uncleanneſs; and hence it is called <hi>Sodom:</hi> and ſecondly, it is called <hi>Egypt</hi> becauſe of the ſlavery of the Jews, and their hardſhips which they ſuffer in that time under the Antichriſt, of which there bondage, &amp; captivity, under <hi>Pharaoh</hi> King of <hi>Egypt</hi> was a type; and ſo in reſpect of cruelty, ſlavery, and bondage it might fitly be called <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſo it is called ſpiritually <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> and yet it was where our Lord was crucified; if it ſhould be ſuppoſed to be <hi>Rome,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our Lord ſuffered under the <hi>Roman</hi> power, it is denyed upon theſe two reaſons, the firſt is, becauſe it is not the power under which our Lord was crucified, but the place where our Lord was crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the two Witneſſes were ſlain: and ſecondly, <hi>Rome</hi> is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed before by the ſame ten Horns that are upon the Beaſt; &amp; have given their power unto him, even they ſhall hate the Whore (<hi>viz.</hi> Rome) and make her deſolate, and burn her with fire, <hi>Revel.</hi> 17.16, 17, 18. And thus I ſhall leave theſe things to thy ſerious peruſal, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring thee (courteous Reader) to inlarge it in thy meditations; for although I have been neceſſitated to be very brief, yet by this little which hath been ſaid thou maiſt underſtand the ſcope of it more at large, becauſe when thou readeſt the Prophets, they will further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct thee in theſe things, when once thou haſt the knowledg of it in thy mind, (if it be but in a ſmall meaſure) and thou maiſt ſee in ſhort who the Woman is, which is to flie into the Wilderneſs, and what her Man-child is, and who are the remnant of her ſeed, &amp; what Wilderneſs ſhe is to flie into, and how long ſhe ſhall abide there, and who the two Witneſſes are, and of their Propheſying, and to whom, and how long, and of their being ſlain, and the place where: And thus deſiring the Lord to inlarge thy underſtanding in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Myſteries of Chriſt, and to guide thy feet into the way of peace, and to bring thee into his everlaſting Kingdome, thorow Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, to whom be aſcribed (as is due) all Power, Might, Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, Dominion, and Praiſe, now and for ever, Amen.</p>

                  <p>I Shall anſwer thy deſire in Anſwering of thy <hi>Queries,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I know, that all the <hi>Queries</hi> propounded, are not ſuch things as thou wants ſatisfaction in; but I underſtand (as thou in a meaſure hath ſignified to me by Letter) that in ſome of them thou (rather) aimeſt at the ſatisfaction of ſome other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or perſons; but however it be, whether thy ſelf or others, yet I ſhall at all times according to the meaſure of the gift of God unto me, be willing to impart it unto others; that I may be a good Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of God, not hiding my Talent in a Napkin: And thus I come to the firſt <hi>Query;</hi> which is,</p>
                  <p>Query 1. <hi>Whether the Man of Sin, or the Antichriſt, ſhall ariſe before the Children of Iſrael return to build their City and Temple?</hi>

would much fail me to open theſe Scriptures, and compare them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with others which relates to this thing; but remember the little Horn, or the eighth is of the ſeventh, and to appear in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry latter dayes, at the end of the fourth Kingdome, and the fifth Kindome is the Kingdome of Chriſt: and thus I paſs to the ſecond; which is,</p>
                  <p>Quer. 2. <hi>Whether the Man of Sin ſhall be of the Aſſyrians?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea, it doth appear, that the Man of Sin ſhall be an <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</hi> from theſe Scriptures, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.24, 25. <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.24, 25, 26. <hi>Chap.</hi> 30.30, 31. <hi>Micah</hi> 5.5, 6. Time alſo would fail me to ſhew you how <hi>Salmonazer</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> took the ten Tribes out of <hi>Samaria</hi> in the dayes of <hi>Hoſea;</hi> and of <hi>Senacharibs</hi> coming up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Judah, in the fourteenth year of the raign of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> King of Judah; and of the Angel of the Lord ſmiting the Camp of they <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrians,</hi> a type of their deſtruction in the latter dayes, upon the Mountains of Iſrael: and further obſerve, that <hi>Ezekiel</hi> calls <hi>Gogg</hi> and his company, (which is to be underſtood the Man of Sin) thoſe of the North Quarters, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38.6.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That there is to be a City and Temple built, I have before proved; but thy <hi>Query</hi> lyeth in theſe words (as I underſtand) <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the ſame that</hi> Titus <hi>demoliſhed, yea, or nay?</hi> To which I ſay, that it appears to be the ſame (that is to ſay, the ſame) both in reſpect of the form and place, for it is to be built upon the old Baſis; and that it is to be underſtood the building or repairing of it demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by <hi>Titus,</hi> is clear, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>They ſhall build the old WASTES, they ſhall raiſe up the former deſolations, and they ſhall repair the waſte Cities, the deſolations of MANY GENERATI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ONS, Iſa.</hi> 61.4. <hi>Chap.</hi> 58.12. <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.18, 19, 20.

                  <p>But if it ſhould be objected, that this Propheſie is already fulfilled; I ſhould deſire to know when, for here is mention of the ten Tribes to have their place in this City then, as well as the two Tribes; and that was not fulfilled when Judah came out of their captivity in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon; but this Propheſie relates to the time when <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> ſhall be one, after Iſraels return out of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> as you may

                  <p>Quer. 4. <hi>Whether ſhall the Jews be ſuccoured in the time of the Man of Sins raign, by any Nation that ſhall be unſubdued by the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt?</hi>

I could cite many Scriptures more, but I paſs.</p>
                  <p>Quer. 5. <hi>Whether ſhall the Jews be changed at the coming of Chriſt and made immortal, as the believing Gentiles? or whether ſhall nature have more years accompanying it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I do not find in Scripture, that any ſhall-be raiſed from the dead (at the coming of the Lord) but as have dyed in the Lord; neither do I find that any ſhall be changed amongſt the living at that day, but ſuch as have (before that day) believed in Chriſt, and waited for him; for at his coming, <hi>two ſhall be in one bed, the one ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and the other left behind;</hi> and the Saints are to judge the twelve Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> not when the twelve Tribes are changed into an immortal ſtate, but before; for I do not find that one immortal Saint ſhall judge (or govern) another, who himſelf (when ſo judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) is immortal, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.40. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4 15, 16. <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.6, 7, 8. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.30. But if it ſhould be Objected and ſaid, what correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency can there be between bodies mortal, and bodies immortal? I Anſwer and ſay, in what may they not correſpond in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce one with another? Was there not correſpondency between Chriſt (after his reſurrection) and his Diſciples which were in their mortal bodies? did they not walk together and diſcourſe? yea, did they not eat together after his reſurrection? ſurely they had ſociety and communion one with another, although Chriſt was raiſed from the dead, and his Diſciples lived in their mortal bodies, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.38, 39, to the 48. And that nature ſhall have more years is clear, from the Text cited, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.19.20. and alſo, <hi>Zech.</hi> 8.4. and more which might be added; but I paſs ſaying, that I have ſpoke more or leſs to the chifeſt part of thy Queries already, as thou maiſt read at thy leiſure in my Book elſewhere.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I do not find in Scripture, mention made but of two Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, one given from God by <hi>Moſes</hi> as a mediatour, and the other by Chriſt; and as for the ſecond or new Teſtament which is by Chriſt, the Jews did reject, and therefore it was taken from them, and they ſhut up under unbelief until the fulneſs of the Gentiles; and I do not find that the goſpel adminiſtrations are to remain any longer than until the fulneſs of the Gentiles, which will be at the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Lord Jeſus: and as touching the Goſpel, the Jews are to be enemies unto it, and (as I before have ſaid) I never find that the preaching of the Goſpel, is the way to turn the whole houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> from their ſins, but God hath appointed another way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertion to the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> namely, the glorious appearing of Chriſt in the Clouds of Heaven, at which time the ſpirit of grace and ſupplication, ſhall be poured out upon them, when they look upon him whom they pierced; then ſhall they mourn and ſay, this is our God, we have waited for him, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.38, 39 <hi>Rom.</hi> 11 26, 27, 28. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.18, 19, 20. And as touching the two places of Scripture cited, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Mich.</hi> 4.2. to prove that the Law ſhall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem; it appears that as the Jews ſhall be waiting for their King in the Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> even ſo thoſe Laws ſhall remain with the Jews in that day, read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.20, 21, 22, 23, 24. <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21. There is many Scriptures ſpeaks to this purpoſe, but I ſtudy brevity, only giving thoſe Scriptures which lie before me in my mind at preſent, and ſo paſs to the ſeventh Query; which is,</p>
                  <p>Quer. 7. <hi>How it may appear that Chriſt ſhall raign in Mount-Zion in Jeruſalem, and judge in the valley of</hi> Jehoſhaphat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This alſo I have before ſhewed, that although the Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſhall be trod without the gates at the valley of <hi>Iehoſhaphat,</hi> ſo as blood to come out even to the horſes bridle, when the Man of Sin ſhall go forth with fury to deſtroy the Jews at the Womans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and the ten Tribes with her, yet afterwards Jeruſalem ſhall be cleanſed, and Chriſt ſhall have his Seat there, as I have fully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in this Book, <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.44, 45. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 39.11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.20. So then the great ſlaughter ſhall be without Jeruſalem in the valley of <hi>Iehoſhaphat,</hi> where he will judge or plead with the heathen with fire and the ſword, yet he ſhall afterwards poſſeſs Jeruſalem or Zion his holy Mountain, and his Throne ſhall be in the place where
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:119763:113"/>
his Father <hi>Davids</hi> was, where he ſhall raign in Mount-Zion in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, thenceforth even for ever, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24.23. chap. 9.7. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.32, 33.</p>
                  <p>Quer. 8. <hi>Whether the new</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>that ſhall come down from Heaven, be the place for Chriſt and the Saints to raign in?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Scripture ſaith that they that are ſaved, ſhall walk in the light of it, and ſhall go no more out, and there ſhall in no wiſe enter into it that which is unclean, but ſuch as are written in the Lambs Book of life, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.24, 27. cap. 3.12. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 36.1, 2, 3. So then that is the place for Chriſt, and the Saints where they ſhall be glorified, and there they ſhall remain for ever; for it is the City which <hi>Abraham</hi> looked for, whoſe maker and builder is the Lord, and it is Gods Tabernacle which ſhall be with men when he ſhall dwell with them.</p>
                  <p>Quer. 9. <hi>What ſhall be the condition of the wicked, and alſo of ſuch as ſhall believe in Chriſt, and own him, in the time of Chriſts raign?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> As for the wicked, they ſhall have great Judgments in this life, as I before have ſhewed, their eyes ſhall conſume in their holes, and their fleſh ſhall conſume from their bones while they ſtand upon their feet, and afterwards have their due deſerts at the time when all ſhall ariſe at the general Judgment, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.12, 18. <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.12. And as for thoſe that do believe and obey Chriſt, ſo as to come up to worſhip the King the Lord of Hoſts, even ſuch Gentiles ſhall have priviledges, although inferiour to the Jews, and ſee his glory, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.10, 11, 12, 13, 14. chap. 61.1. chap. 66.23.</p>
                  <p>Quer. 10. <hi>Whether ſhall the deſolation of the Heavens, ſpoken by Peter, be at the time of his coming to raign, or at the time when the thouſand years ſhall be expired, at the bringing in of the general judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It appears clearly from the Scriptures, that Jeſus Chriſt at his firſt coming, to receive the Kingdome and to raign upon earth, that then he is to come in flaming fire, ſo as fiery ſtreams ſhall iſſue forth from before him; and that many of the ungodly ſhall periſh by the flame, and ſome by the baile, and the like; and alſo that he is to abide in the Heavens until the times (or years) of the reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all things, ſpoken by the mouth af all the holy Prophets ſince the World began; and yet alſo we find, that at the end of the thouſand years, that when the ungodly (that ſhall ſpring up in the time of Chriſts raign) ſhall come up againſt <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the counſel of the Devil, that then fire ſhall come down from God out
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:119763:114"/>
of Heaven and devoure them; ſo that (in ſhort) I underſtand that the corruptions of the Heaven and earth, ſhall be burnt up, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, or the Heavens and earth refined at Chriſts firſt coming, and yet the work to be totally finiſhed at the end, becauſe it is called <hi>TIMES</hi> (in the plural number) of reſtitution, and <hi>TIMES</hi> of refreſhing, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.10. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7, 8. Ezek. 38.22. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.15, 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19.20, 21. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10, 11, 12, 13, 14. <hi>Revel.</hi> 20.9.</p>
                  <p>Quer. 11. <hi>What is the new Heaven and new Earth, and how ſhall they become new?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Heaven and the Earth is underſtood to be a new Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and a new Earth, when the imperfection and corruption is taken away; and ſo all things are to become new: and that the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of both the Heavens and Earth ſhall be taken away, ſo as that the Earth ſhall bring forth in abundance, and the Heavens alſo far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel their brightneſs which they have now; ſo that the light of the Moon ſhall be as the light of the Sun, and the Sun ſhall be ſeven de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees better than what now ſhe is; read my <hi>Zions Redemption</hi> and you may ſee it proved to be glorious in the time of Chriſts raign, in which time the Heavens and Earth ſhall be glorious, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.24, 25, 26. cap. 65.17, 18. cap 66.22.</p>
                  <p>Quer. 12. <hi>Whether the new Heavens and new Earth and reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhall be at Chriſts coming to raign upon Earth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Heavens are to retain Chriſt, until the times of reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (as I before have ſaid) ſo that the beginning of the work is immediately ſo ſoon as Chriſt comes, and ſo to increaſe and grow more ſtronger and excellenter, as now the Earth &amp; the things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, grow older and older, and weaker and weaker, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.7. chap. 29.19. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27, 28, 29, 30.</p>
                  <p>Quer. 13. <hi>Whether or no ſhall Chriſt and the Saints raign for ever upon the Earth or not?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It appears that Chriſt and the Saints ſhall not raign for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, becauſe there is a time when the mediatour-ſhip ſhall be given up into the hands of the Father, when the Son ſhall be in ſubjection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, ſo as to lay down his government unto him; and yet it ſhall be for ever in one ſenſe, that is for ever, ſo long as there ſhall be a Nation upon earth to raign over; but as for their ſcituation and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode, I underſtand it ſhall be for ever in the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down from Heaven, which is, and for ever will be the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of God, which then ſhall remain in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and ſo the Tabernacle of God to be with man, and he for ever dwell with
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:119763:114"/>
them; for I do not find that the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhall be again remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24, 25, 26, 27, 28. <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Chap. 3.12.</p>
                  <p>Quer. 14. <hi>If Chriſt and the Saints ſhall remain for ever</hi> (in the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) <hi>upon the earth, where ſhall the Devil and man of ſin with the wicked</hi> (of the World) <hi>be puniſhed?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It appears from the Scripture, as though that the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> were to remain for ever as the new Heaven and new Earth, <hi>Iſa</hi> 65.17, 18, 19. and that the puniſhment of the wicked ſhould be without the gates or diaſes of the Land, even in <hi>Babylon, Caldea</hi> and <hi>Idumea,</hi> and the like, read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 34.4, 5, to the 10. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 35.14, 15. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 47.14. chap. 51.19. <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.2.</p>
                  <p>Quer. 15. <hi>Whether will Chriſt render vengeance to all the ungodly beſides the perpetual torments that he will caſt them into at the end of the thouſand years?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It appears that there are ſome that ſhall have only their power taken from them, and their lives to be prolonged for a ſeaſon, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.12. and alſo although great judgments ſhall fall upon the wicked, yet there will a ſeed remain of them, which ſhall be reſerved to be deſtroyed at the end of the thouſand years, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.29, 30. <hi>Revel.</hi> 20 9.</p>
                  <p>Quer. 16. <hi>Whether the puniſhment of the wicked be everlaſting, after the ſentence is paſt, at the general judgment?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> It appears to be everlaſting, although I know there be ſome that ſuppoſe a redemption out of Hell, from the words of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.26. which ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt by no means come from thence, till thou haſt paid the utmoſt farthing.</hi> This place intends no ſuch thing, but is rather literally to be underſtood; but if by priſon there ſpoken of, we may underſtand Hell; yet it will not follow there is to be a redemption out of Hell, as ſome ſuppoſe; for the word <hi>until,</hi> ſometimes is never to be, as it is ſaid, <hi>that Samuel came no more to ſee Saul until the day of his death.</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.35. And he cannot then but ſuppoſe the word until, ſhould prefix a ſet time, yet the Text ſaith, that <hi>thou ſhalt not come from thence, until thou haſt paid the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt farthing;</hi> and ſuppoſe a man were caſt into priſon for five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds, and had not five hundred pence, nor in a capacity to gain while he lay in priſon, if he ſhould not come from thence till he had paid the utmoſt farthing, he could never come out; and ſuch is the condition of the wicked, that as their debt is very great, even ſo they are in an incapacity to gain when they are in Hell, whereby to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:119763:115"/>
pay their debt, and none can pay it for them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.7, 8. And ſo if they muſt pay the utmoſt farthing it will never be paid; no, the puniſhment of the wicked is everlaſting deſtruction from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord, where the worm ſhall not die, nor the fire be quenched, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66, 24.</p>
                  <p>Quer 17. <hi>When can it be truly ſaid,</hi> (according to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22.) <hi>That in Adam all dyed; when it is plain that</hi> Enoch <hi>was tranſlated ſo as not to taft of death, with</hi> Elijah, and Iohn, chap. 21.23.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Whereas the Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. ſaith, that <hi>as in Adam all dyed, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All in Scripture is often taken for the Major part, and not every individual perſon, for we know that many ſhall be changed at the coming of Chriſt, and be caught up to meet him, and ſo was <hi>Enoch</hi> changed or tranſlated, which is all one as death; but that which is ſpoken by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. ſaying, <hi>As in Adam all dyed, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.</hi> It is to be thus underſtood, that ſo many as did die by <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, was made alive by Chriſts obedience, and raiſed from the duſt; finally e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular perſon muſt die, or be changed, for this corruptable body cannot enter into the Kingdome of God, but muſt firſt put on incorruption and immortality; and this change had <hi>Enoch:</hi> and as for <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> I have before ſhewed what will befal them, when they have accompliſhed their propheſie; and thus leaving this Query, I ſhall paſs to the next and laſt; which is,</p>
                  <p>Quer. 18. <hi>If Chriſt be the firſt fruits of them that ſleep (that is to ſay, the firſt that is to ariſe from the dead) how is it then that ſome Saints did ariſe at the time of Chriſts ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Thoſe Saints that were ſeen to come out of their graves and enter into the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly City, was after the reſur<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ction of Chriſt, and not at his ſufferings, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27 53. So then Chriſt was the firſt which was raiſed from the dead. I could have ſpoken ſomewhat more to this and other things, but time fails me; and as for the other particulars men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in thy letter, I have ſpoken unto them in my Book as Objections, (and ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions) have offered themſelves, and therefore have no more at preſent to ſay unto thee, only exhorting thee to ſtand faſt in the faith, and profeſſion of the Goſpel; for dear Brother, (as thou well knoweſt) the portion of the godly is to ſuffer tribulation for Chriſt (and the Goſpel) ſake, becauſe thorow many tribulations we muſt enter into the Kingdome of God, for they that are born after the fleſh, will perſecute ſuch as are born after the ſpirit; for ſo it was, and is, and will be unto the end, and it ſhall come to paſs, that thoſe that kill the godly, ſhall think that they do God ſervice, but however, let us know that all things ſhall work together for good to thoſe that love God, and that the end is a crown of life to ſuch as are faithful unto the death, and then it will be the time that God will recompence tribulation to them that trouble his people, that it had been good for them that they had never been born, or that a milſtone hanged about their neck, and they caſt into the depth of the Sea, than to offend the friends of Ieſus Chriſt finally, he that ſoweth in tears ſhall reap in joy, and he that goeth forth weeping bearing precious ſeed, ſhall doubtleſs return rejoycing with everlaſting joy upon his head, and all ſighing and ſorrow ſhall flee away; and for their ſhame they ſhall have double, and for their confuſion they ſhall rejoyce in their portion; for in their land double everlaſting joy ſhall be their portion.</p>
